[0:01:06] caller: I do not know.
[0:01:06] caller: Okay.
[0:01:12] operator: All right.
[0:01:12] operator: We'll be there.
[0:01:12] operator: Is the person who stabbed him here?
[0:01:12] operator: I'm sorry, say that again?
[0:01:17] caller: No, he's out.
[0:01:17] caller: He left.
[0:01:17] caller: I don't know.
[0:01:17] caller: Okay.
[0:01:17] caller: We have the paramedics on the way.
[0:01:23] operator: Bye-bye.
[0:01:23] operator: Thanks.
[0:01:23] operator: Bye-bye.
[0:01:24] caller: Yes, Frankie's Bar.
[0:01:26] operator: We need an ambulance.
[0:01:27] caller: We've got a patient bleeding excessively.
[0:01:29] operator: Okay.
[0:01:30] caller: We've got them on the way.
[0:01:32] operator: All right.
[0:01:32] operator: Thank you.
[0:01:32] operator: Thank you.
[0:01:32] operator: Bye-bye.
[0:01:32] operator: Neighbor, 911.
[0:01:35] operator: How may I help you?
[0:01:36] caller: Yeah, we need an ambulance at 16 West Chicago.
[0:01:36] caller: Frankie's Bar.
[0:01:41] operator: Features Bar and Grill.
[0:01:42] caller: Frankie's Bar and Grill right away.
[0:01:44] operator: Frankie's or Features?
[0:01:46] caller: Frankie's upstairs.
[0:01:47] operator: What's going on?
[0:01:48] caller: There's, I don't know, somebody got pushed into somebody and there's blood everywhere.
[0:01:48] caller: Some guy's holding his wrist.
[0:01:48] caller: I think he's, like, bleeding out right now.
[0:01:54] operator: Oh, okay.
[0:01:54] operator: Is there someone with him?
[0:01:57] caller: There's people, yeah.
[0:01:57] caller: There's people all around him upstairs, but we need somebody.
[0:02:00] operator: Hold on a second.

Name: Wallis Nolan, Address: 17164 Dakota Alley
[0:00:02] caller: How's it going?
[0:00:02] caller: I robbed somebody downtown Portland at 9th Point.
[0:00:09] operator: And I would just like to let you guys know that I did that.
[0:00:12] caller: And I'm about to commit suicide.
[0:00:12] caller: I'm standing on a 10 story high building.
[0:00:16] operator: Okay, where at?
[0:00:16] operator: I don't want to release that information.
[0:00:16] operator: I just would like to let you guys know that...
[0:00:16] operator: You're not going to tell me where you are and why you're calling me?
[0:00:16] operator: Because I'd like to let you guys know that I committed a robbery and you guys need to clean my body up here soon.
[0:00:16] operator: Okay, what's your name?
[0:00:16] operator: Brad Morgan.
[0:00:16] operator: Is there anybody we should call to let them know?
[0:00:41] operator: I'd like you to contact Karina Bartley, but you know, it's up to you guys.
[0:00:41] operator: Okay, do you have a phone number for this person?
[0:00:50] caller: She ain't going to answer the phone.
[0:00:50] caller: I've been trying to contact her.
[0:00:53] operator: And who is this person to you?
[0:00:55] caller: She is my ex-girlfriend.
[0:00:57] operator: Okay.
[0:00:57] operator: How long ago did she become your ex-girlfriend?
[0:01:02] caller: About three weeks ago.
[0:01:05] operator: Okay.
[0:01:05] operator: And you are going to jump off the building because of that or because of some other reason?
[0:01:11] caller: I have gotten myself into a lot of trouble lately.
[0:01:11] caller: And my girlfriend took my son from me and denied my visiting time.
[0:01:11] caller: I tried going to the courts and working things out.
[0:01:23] caller: My life is just shitty anyways, so I feel that I no longer need to live.
[0:01:28] operator: Okay.
[0:01:28] operator: And that's your final decision?
[0:01:28] operator: There's no way I can talk you out of that?
[0:01:28] operator: No.
[0:01:28] operator: I just would like to let you guys know, just for a heads up, what's going on.
[0:01:28] operator: Okay.
[0:01:28] operator: Tell me her name again.
[0:01:40] caller: I didn't write it down quickly enough.
[0:01:42] operator: Karina Bartley.
[0:01:42] operator: What is her phone number?
[0:01:42] operator: Um, hold on one second.
[0:01:42] operator: It's 503-839-9369, 839-3689.
[0:02:06] operator: 839-3689?
[0:02:06] operator: Correct.
[0:02:06] operator: This is the ex-girlfriend who's the mother of your child?
[0:02:06] operator: Yeah.
[0:02:06] operator: How old's your child?
[0:02:14] caller: He's 8 months old.
[0:02:16] operator: It seems too bad that you're not going to get to see him and talk to him when he's older, don't you think?
[0:02:23] caller: After I'd be in jail, I would have passed him anyway.
[0:02:27] operator: Don't you think he'd still prefer you were alive so he has a dad?
[0:02:33] caller: He probably would, but, you know, I'm thinking past that right now.
[0:02:39] operator: Okay.
[0:02:39] operator: How did you get up to the building there?
[0:02:39] operator: Did you walk or did you drive?
[0:02:43] caller: I don't have a vehicle so I walk.
[0:02:46] operator: Okay.
[0:02:46] operator: And you're just on top of like somebody's business or a parking structure or what?
[0:02:51] caller: I'm on top of a 10 story building.
[0:02:54] operator: Okay, right.
[0:02:54] operator: Like a parking structure or like somebody's business or what kind of building are we talking about?
[0:03:00] caller: It's a parking structure and I got a visual view of Pioneer Square.
[0:03:11] operator: Why don't you talk to me just a little bit longer before you do anything you can't take back?
[0:03:17] caller: I know I can't take it back once I do it and I really am debating on doing it or not but
[0:03:25] caller: my criminal background will be believed much out of this story.
[0:03:30] operator: Well you know what, I'm going to give you a really great deal.
[0:03:30] operator: Are you ready for this?
[0:03:30] operator: What?
[0:03:34] caller: This is a one-time only deal, and only from me.
[0:03:37] operator: I will believe everything you tell me on this phone call, everything.
[0:03:37] operator: You have my word.
[0:03:48] operator: Okay, so talk to somebody who is prepared to believe you.
[0:03:48] operator: Tell me your side.
[0:03:58] caller: All right, first off, the reason why my girlfriend broke up with me is because we got into a little argument.
[0:03:58] caller: She told the police officer that I hung up the phone while she was trying to make a police report, and that's why I got arrested.
[0:03:58] caller: I sat in jail for four days and got a restraining order for while I was in there.
[0:04:21] operator: When was that?
[0:04:21] operator: Was that a long time ago?
[0:04:24] caller: No, just recently.
[0:04:25] operator: Okay.
[0:04:26] caller: And the cops wouldn't believe me because of my record.
[0:04:30] operator: Okay.
[0:04:31] caller: And that's why I went to jail.
[0:04:32] operator: Well, if that's what she said, you tell me what really happened.
[0:04:32] operator: Tell me your side.
[0:04:37] caller: I was trying to leave with my son.
[0:04:37] caller: She took my son from me, so I took him back and pushed her away from the door because she was trying to hold me in our apartment.
[0:04:37] caller: Not, like, shoved her, but, like, put my hand on the doorknob
[0:04:53] operator: and, like, elbowed her away a little bit.
[0:04:55] caller: And then I started proceeding down to the max to get on the max to go see my parents.
[0:04:55] caller: and she flagged down a sheriff that was driving by, just so happens,
[0:05:05] operator: and she gave him her side of the story and I gave him mine.
[0:05:09] caller: And the only reason he arrested me is because I hung up the phone on the police call.
[0:05:09] caller: I understand that was a bad thing at the time, but he got me arrested and he made it so I couldn't see my son even longer than I was supposed to.
[0:05:25] operator: And then after that, my girlfriend says, you can call and talk to your son.
[0:05:31] caller: And when I call and talk to my son, she calls the police and says I'm contacting her.
[0:05:35] operator: And now they want to arrest me for that.
[0:05:35] operator: Okay, was there like a no contact order or something?
[0:05:35] operator: Yes.
[0:05:35] operator: Okay.
[0:05:35] operator: And on top of that, I was supposed to get...
[0:05:35] operator: And then she called the police when you did, yeah?
[0:05:35] operator: Yes.
[0:05:35] operator: Okay.
[0:05:35] operator: Okay.
[0:05:51] caller: And then basically, I don't know.
[0:05:51] caller: I feel like I no longer need to live.
[0:05:51] caller: She's putting me down every which way she can.
[0:06:05] operator: Okay.
[0:06:05] caller: I have nobody besides her.
[0:06:08] operator: Well, hang on just a second.
[0:06:08] operator: So the initial call into no contact order, did that come from the judge after this hang-up-the-phone incident?
[0:06:08] operator: It came from the judge, yes, after the...
[0:06:22] caller: Because that's a temporary thing for now.
[0:06:25] operator: I mean, that's not an irrevocable, you're never going to see your son again thing.
[0:06:25] operator: You just have to work through the system and write it out for a little while.
[0:06:32] caller: That's the problem.
[0:06:32] caller: I've been going through the system my whole life, and I'm tired of it.
[0:06:32] caller: Most of the time it wasn't even my fault.
[0:06:41] caller: And I've just done some bad things in my life, and I feel that this is the consequence for it.
[0:06:48] operator: Well, doing bad things.
[0:06:48] operator: I mean, everybody does bad things, but what you need to do is grow, become better because of it.
[0:06:48] operator: Not just end your life.
[0:06:48] operator: That's kind of cheating, don't you think?
[0:07:01] operator: I mean, you get to suffer the consequences of what you did.
[0:07:01] operator: I mean, you know that.
[0:07:01] operator: You're telling me that yourself.
[0:07:01] operator: But then you learn and you become a better man for it.
[0:07:12] operator: You know, I appreciate the sweet talk.
[0:07:14] caller: I really do.
[0:07:14] caller: It feels good to actually be on the top when they find me.
[0:07:20] operator: Yeah.
[0:07:21] caller: Well, I'm not blowing smoke.
[0:07:21] caller: I really believe that, really.
[0:07:25] operator: Everybody gets to suffer the consequences of what they do, but you get to be better.
[0:07:25] operator: You get to choose to be better and do better.
[0:07:34] caller: That's the problem.
[0:07:34] caller: When I try to choose to be better and do better, it just crashes back down on me.
[0:07:40] operator: Well, you said you don't have anybody but her.
[0:07:40] operator: Have you tried to get help?
[0:07:44] caller: I mean, I assume there's some other thing.
[0:07:47] operator: You said you've been working with the system for a long time, so I'm guessing.
[0:07:51] caller: Well, like I said, I've had a criminal background.
[0:07:54] operator: Right.
[0:07:55] caller: I'm with the wrong crowd and the wrong things that I shouldn't have done.
[0:07:58] operator: Okay.
[0:07:58] operator: Well, you admit that you took responsibility for making bad choices.
[0:07:58] operator: Excellent.
[0:07:58] operator: But you don't have to stay there forever.
[0:07:58] operator: You're not stuck there forever.
[0:07:58] operator: You get to choose to be different.
[0:08:11] operator: You know what I'm doing right now?
[0:08:12] caller: I'm choosing the finishes.
[0:08:15] operator: Everybody dies.
[0:08:15] operator: That doesn't make you different.
[0:08:15] operator: You want to be a better man, not a dead man.
[0:08:15] operator: Your son needs you to be a better man.
[0:08:24] caller: Well, the reason why I'm really mad is she's posting on Facebook and making it visible for me to see that she's basically with another guy.
[0:08:24] caller: I feel the whole reason that she even did this whole ordeal
[0:08:36] operator: was to get the domestic violence grant.
[0:08:39] operator: And now on top of that, I took care of my son the whole first eight months last year,
[0:08:46] caller: and she's claiming him on the taxes.
[0:08:46] caller: So I don't even need to move him to her own place.
[0:08:46] caller: Yeah, it sounds like you're not exactly getting a fair deal there, I would agree.
[0:09:00] operator: But just removing yourself from the equation, that doesn't hurt her, you know.
[0:09:00] operator: I mean, I'm not recommending you stay alive so you can make her pay.
[0:09:10] caller: That's not what I mean at all.
[0:09:11] operator: What I mean is you're punishing yourself for crap she's doing.
[0:09:16] caller: Don't do that.
[0:09:16] caller: Well, I feel that I was part of it.
[0:09:16] caller: I'm not blaming it all on her.
[0:09:23] operator: Of course.
[0:09:23] operator: You have done your share.
[0:09:25] caller: Everybody agrees.
[0:09:27] operator: It sounds like you've done your share.
[0:09:31] operator: But you don't have to stay there.
[0:09:31] operator: You don't have to keep making choices that put you in that same situation.
[0:09:41] caller: Yeah, but even on top, like, there's the little things that I've done.
[0:09:41] caller: She even got my cousin against me, and she has the cops, you know, on her side no matter what the fuck I do or say.
[0:09:41] caller: You know, I mean, I've been fighting the courts and the police my whole life, and I'm tired of it.
[0:09:41] caller: Like, honestly, I feel like shooting one of them right now.
[0:09:41] caller: Okay, well, don't do that.
[0:10:01] operator: First of all, Brad, the police are in the area looking for you because they want to talk to you too.
[0:10:01] operator: They don't want you to be dead on the pavement.
[0:10:08] caller: This is the second time I've attempted to commit suicide, and honestly, I think this is going to be the final time.
[0:10:15] operator: Okay, well, please don't.
[0:10:15] operator: The police are asking if you'll tell me what you're wearing so they can find you and help you.
[0:10:22] caller: I'm wearing a red backpack and a hoodie.
[0:10:25] operator: What color?
[0:10:25] operator: Black with red on the front.
[0:10:25] operator: Do you have any guns on you since you mentioned shooting?
[0:10:33] operator: Possibly.
[0:10:43] operator: I'm just telling them what you said.
[0:10:50] caller: I'd actually prefer for a police officer to shoot me at this point.
[0:10:50] caller: I'm not looking forward to it.
[0:10:55] operator: But how do you think that will make the cops feel?
[0:10:59] caller: I vote pretty good because that's what they do for a living.
[0:10:59] caller: No, it isn't what they do.
[0:11:04] operator: Have you ever watched cops and seen what they do?
[0:11:08] caller: Yes, I have.
[0:11:09] operator: Have you ever been in the MFD steps where you're being beat by a night stick and down in the back of the car?
[0:11:16] caller: I have not been beaten by, no.
[0:11:16] caller: They're brutal.
[0:11:18] operator: They do not want to shoot you.
[0:11:18] operator: They don't want to kill you.
[0:11:18] operator: They don't want to take your life.
[0:11:23] caller: I wouldn't take one of their lives.
[0:11:23] caller: I honestly do.
[0:11:26] operator: And, you know, the same cops been circling around this building, like,
[0:11:34] caller: and he doesn't know how to get in or something.
[0:11:37] operator: How did you get in?
[0:11:39] caller: I walked up the stairs.
[0:11:41] operator: On what side?
[0:11:44] operator: On the Mac side, the side with the Macs.
[0:11:50] operator: All right.
[0:11:51] caller: And if it's a street sweeper, at least it'll be easy to clean up.
[0:11:58] operator: That would be a bad outcome, right?
[0:12:01] caller: That would make me sad.
[0:12:03] operator: It makes you sad.
[0:12:05] caller: Yeah, it would make me very, very sad.
[0:12:07] operator: Because I've been talking to you, you know.
[0:12:07] operator: You've never met me, I've never met you, but we've talked and you've told me some personal stuff, and even a little bit, I feel like I know you just a little bit,
[0:12:19] caller: and it would make me sad if he died tonight.
[0:12:24] caller: I'm a good person, you know, I can try to be, I try to be.
[0:12:24] caller: But no matter which way I put it, I just want my girlfriend, she puts me in the way.
[0:12:24] caller: She's telling me how happy she is with her other guy or whatever.
[0:12:41] caller: And it's not, it doesn't feel good.
[0:12:46] operator: So you said that she's posting on Facebook, but she's blocked you.
[0:12:46] operator: How did you know about the Facebook thing if she blocked you?
[0:12:53] caller: Because I have friends that have her as a friend, and I'm on their Facebook.
[0:13:00] caller: Okay, so hopefully I look at that, but I don't know how Facebook works.
[0:13:04] operator: Does that mean you can see her again?
[0:13:05] caller: I can see her posts through another person.
[0:13:08] operator: Oh, I got you.
[0:13:08] operator: Okay.
[0:13:10] operator: And on top of that, she deleted me and then wrote on there, I'm done with you, leave me alone.
[0:13:10] operator: It's like, what do you mean you're done with me?
[0:13:10] operator: You've got the kid and I are talking on it?
[0:13:25] caller: We were perfectly fine until she had the kid.
[0:13:28] operator: You know, it was a plan.
[0:13:29] caller: I didn't see anything.
[0:13:31] operator: And now...
[0:13:35] operator: How long were you guys together?
[0:13:35] operator: Like two and a half years, maybe three years.
[0:13:43] operator: And so, let's see, so like a year in you guys decided to have a baby?
[0:13:48] caller: My kid is only eight months old.
[0:13:52] operator: How old are you?
[0:13:53] caller: I'm 21.
[0:13:56] operator: Well, I suppose I sound like your mom if I said that's awfully young to have a kid, huh?
[0:14:02] caller: My mom actually wanted me to have a kid because she has heart problems and she wanted to be around for it.
[0:14:11] caller: And she's putting my mom through not being able to see and hear.
[0:14:19] caller: And it makes me feel like shit because I feel like it's my fault.
[0:14:26] caller: But at the same time, I have a feeling that she was dating somebody behind my back and
[0:14:31] operator: then obviously wanted to be with them or something.
[0:14:35] caller: She wrote on Facebook, you know, oh, thanks for the great night.
[0:14:35] caller: And then the next post was, I want my pants back.
[0:14:35] caller: It's like, dude, come on.
[0:14:43] operator: You fucking hoe.
[0:14:43] operator: You have a kid and all you want is sex now from other people?
[0:14:48] caller: That's not fucking right at all.
[0:14:48] caller: I can't stand the fact that there's going to be another person as my son's father figure.
[0:14:58] operator: Where does she live now?
[0:14:58] operator: Does she live close to where you are?
[0:14:58] operator: I mean, if we needed to, could we help them down?
[0:15:04] caller: No.
[0:15:04] caller: She lives in Gresham.
[0:15:04] caller: I was just on their roof spying on them.
[0:15:04] caller: I was trying to see my son, but the dog kept barking, so I had to leave.
[0:15:13] operator: Ah.
[0:15:15] caller: All I wanted to do was get a visual of my son.
[0:15:28] caller: I don't know, she's playing with me and it's not right at all.
[0:15:35] operator: Well, what I wondered was...
[0:15:35] operator: And on top of that, it's like, can you even go down to the courthouse and get a restraining order on somebody and now you can't contact them?
[0:15:35] operator: It's like, come on, really?
[0:15:35] operator: Did you actually get served with a restraining order?
[0:15:49] caller: Yes, this is my second time.
[0:15:49] caller: The first time, she was fine.
[0:15:49] caller: She was happy with me.
[0:15:55] operator: She says, oh, I'll see you later.
[0:15:56] caller: And next thing I know, there's a sheriff at my door serving me with a restraining order.
[0:15:56] caller: I find out that she gets $400.
[0:15:56] caller: And then on top of that, like, I'm trying to make up with her because I love her and I just want to be with her and be a family.
[0:15:56] caller: And then she comes back with me.
[0:15:56] caller: and I had an apartment with my roommate and I was basically kicked out of there and she stayed there for maybe another week and then moved out, left my roommate high and dry.
[0:15:56] caller: And then I worked things out with her and I was trying to make it back right with my roommate and we go back over there and next thing I know she's pulling it all over again I honestly don't feel that it's right at all.
[0:16:45] operator: Is she older than you?
[0:16:47] caller: No, she's younger.
[0:16:54] operator: Well, you think she's kind of jerking you around, but then you already know that.
[0:17:00] caller: She's playing with me and she's having fun and I'm not going to let her do it anymore.
[0:17:00] caller: Well, I would say this is not the way to make it stop.
[0:17:10] operator: Your police officer found me finally.
[0:17:10] operator: Okay, would you do me a big huge favor?
[0:17:10] operator: Please, please, please don't do anything rash.
[0:17:10] operator: Don't make him hurt you.
[0:17:10] operator: Put your hands up and go talk to him and let them help you.
[0:17:10] operator: Let them get you to a counselor or whatever.
[0:17:25] caller: I'm cool with that.
[0:17:26] operator: Okay, please.
[0:17:28] caller: No, I'm not leaving with these officers.
[0:17:31] caller: I'm definitely not going to leave the beat officers.
[0:17:35] caller: I'm done going to that jailhouse.
[0:17:35] caller: I'm done being treated like a rag doll.
[0:17:40] operator: Tonight, what you're done with me is not a crime.
[0:17:45] caller: These cops are not going to be able to reach me because I was like a monkey and got to where I'm at.
[0:17:54] caller: And they're not going to get to me.
[0:17:59] operator: Okay, well, really, in this instance, they want the same thing for you I want.
[0:18:04] caller: They want to see me jump.
[0:18:04] caller: They'd get a kick out of it.
[0:18:04] caller: I don't know.
[0:18:08] operator: Nobody wants to see you jump.
[0:18:08] operator: Have you ever seen a jumper?
[0:18:12] caller: I have.
[0:18:12] caller: It's horrid.
[0:18:12] caller: It's awful.
[0:18:12] caller: I've never seen one.
[0:18:12] caller: I imagine it's going to be a quick, painful death.
[0:18:27] operator: This is how bad of a person I am.
[0:18:29] caller: I seen a guy come off of an ATM and I walked up to him with my knife and said,
[0:18:35] operator: Give me the money.
[0:18:35] operator: And he handed it to me.
[0:18:39] caller: And the police officer drove past like two seconds after where he could have stopped it, but he didn't notice.
[0:18:39] caller: And the guy didn't shout out for help, luckily.
[0:18:39] caller: And the first homeless person I seen, I gave all the money to.
[0:18:55] operator: So you didn't even keep the money?
[0:18:57] caller: No, I gave it away.
[0:18:59] operator: Can I ask why you took the money, if you were going to keep it?
[0:19:04] caller: I was walking to the top of this building and see the homeless guy laying there on the road.
[0:19:11] operator: and I just felt for him, you know.
[0:19:14] caller: He's a true friend, probably a good friend now.
[0:19:19] operator: Okay.
[0:19:19] operator: And so then when you saw the opportunity, you took the money and went back to him?
[0:19:19] operator: Yeah.
[0:19:28] caller: I'm just sorry for it, but, you know, I don't know what it really came to me, but I felt that it was right.
[0:19:37] caller: That's the problem with me.
[0:19:37] caller: I feel things are right and I do it.
[0:19:37] caller: Most times they're mistakes.
[0:19:44] operator: Well, it sounds to me like you need to talk to a counselor to help you sort out good choices from bad perhaps.
[0:19:50] caller: I've tried talking to people.
[0:19:50] caller: I've tried getting help.
[0:19:53] operator: I wanted to go and sit down with the media or whatever and try to make things work.
[0:19:59] caller: I was going to sign up for Adrian's class or whatever it took.
[0:19:59] caller: When she found out that I was trying to make an effort, she just made more of an effort
[0:20:07] operator: to keep her son from me and to stay farther away.
[0:20:07] operator: Well, here's something else for you to consider.
[0:20:07] operator: If you go ahead and do the things like go to anger management with or without her, and you can show a judge that you are making these efforts because you want to be the father of the boy, then she's...
[0:20:07] operator: I already know that I've already done fucked up just by coming up here and calling you.
[0:20:31] caller: I'm not going to be able to see my son after this.
[0:20:34] operator: Do you really think they're going to let somebody from that plan table see their son after something like this?
[0:20:39] caller: It may sound like this minute, no.
[0:20:41] operator: But what I'm saying is you can still get help and straighten yourself out, and then it will be obvious from the things that you've done to a judge who's going to make the decision that you're making an effort to straighten yourself out.
[0:20:56] caller: I've already tried that.
[0:20:56] caller: I've already tried that.
[0:20:56] caller: It won't believe me.
[0:20:56] caller: They don't believe me.
[0:20:56] caller: It's my record.
[0:21:03] operator: I'm telling you.
[0:21:04] caller: It's three years worth over mine, no matter what.
[0:21:04] caller: That's probably part of it.
[0:21:08] operator: But what I'm saying is you've got to make an effort over time and watch, you know, so up to now you've made bad choices, and that's what they're looking at.
[0:21:08] operator: From now forward, you make good choices so they can look at that.
[0:21:22] operator: You know, honestly, I really do appreciate your high talking.
[0:21:27] caller: It's kind of making me feel better.
[0:21:27] caller: but honestly, I've already fucked up by coming up here and doing what I've done.
[0:21:27] caller: I've already fucked up.
[0:21:35] operator: Okay.
[0:21:35] operator: Don't make it worse by hurting yourself.
[0:21:38] caller: I'm not going to hurt myself.
[0:21:38] caller: I'm going to provoke the police to do it, or I'm going to jump off after that doesn't work.
[0:21:46] operator: Where's the knife you used earlier?
[0:21:48] caller: In my pocket.
[0:21:49] operator: Ah.
[0:21:49] operator: All right.
[0:21:55] caller: If they shoot me, I'm far enough from the edge to fall.
[0:22:06] operator: I'd appreciate it if you'd just go give up to the police.
[0:22:06] operator: I know you would.
[0:22:11] caller: I would almost appreciate it, too.
[0:22:11] caller: But the thing is, I know where they're going to take me.
[0:22:11] caller: I know what they're going to do to me.
[0:22:11] caller: And it's not going to make my girlfriend love me.
[0:22:11] caller: It's me.
[0:22:20] operator: Well, it sounds to me she's this busy messing with you that maybe she's not very nice and you're better off without her.
[0:22:27] caller: But, you know, that's not my decision.
[0:22:28] operator: That's your decision.
[0:22:29] caller: I probably am better off without her.
[0:22:29] caller: And that's what my dad says.
[0:22:34] operator: I love you.
[0:22:34] operator: Well.
[0:22:38] caller: Yeah, and I know.
[0:22:39] operator: How you feel is how you feel.
[0:22:40] caller: There's nothing you can do about that.
[0:22:40] caller: I get that.
[0:22:45] caller: I do.
[0:22:47] operator: And you're kind of tied to her for life anyway because she is the mother of your child.
[0:22:47] operator: Yeah.
[0:22:54] caller: She never realized that.
[0:22:57] operator: We wanted to be a family.
[0:22:57] operator: We agreed to each other that we were going to, no matter what, stick together.
[0:23:04] caller: One little fucking argument, she just bailed out.
[0:23:07] operator: And then already with somebody else.
[0:23:07] operator: Like, come on, dude.
[0:23:11] caller: The fact of me knowing that my girlfriend is sleeping with somebody else, it makes me
[0:23:15] operator: want to kill the other person.
[0:23:16] caller: And then if I'm hurt by that girl, then I'm just going to kill myself and not let off the deal if it don't work.
[0:23:22] operator: Well, but those aren't your only options.
[0:23:22] operator: You're talking like that's your only option, that somebody has to die.
[0:23:28] caller: The police are trying to talk to me.
[0:23:29] operator: I'll let you go.
[0:23:29] operator: Okay.

[0:01:02] operator: I want you to stay on the phone with me.

[0:01:18] caller: She said she's on her way here now.
[0:01:19] operator: How far away is she from your home?
[0:01:22] caller: I really don't know.
[0:01:24] operator: Okay.
[0:01:24] operator: Have you guys looked out the window at all or anything?
[0:01:27] caller: No, because I'm really scared.
[0:01:28] operator: Okay.
[0:01:28] operator: That's okay.
[0:01:29] caller: That's all right.
[0:01:30] operator: All right.
[0:01:31] operator: I'm just trying to type this into the officers, and they're on the way there already, okay?
[0:01:31] operator: Okay.

Name: Valentia Portriss, Address: 04 Vernon Road
[0:00:00] operator: 911, what is your emergency?
[0:00:02] caller: I just shot my wife.
[0:00:04] operator: Can you tell me the address that you're at?
[0:00:07] operator: Yes, but will you tell them to come with a siren going off?
[0:00:10] operator: That's fine.
[0:00:10] operator: What's the address?
[0:00:10] operator: Is that a house or an apartment?
[0:00:14] operator: A house.
[0:00:14] operator: Okay, and what exactly happened?
[0:00:17] caller: She just suffered too much.
[0:00:17] caller: And, uh, we're out of money, out of gas.
[0:00:17] caller: She needed her pill refilled.
[0:00:17] caller: She was suffering.
[0:00:31] caller: We've been through hell, and I couldn't see her suffer anymore.
[0:00:31] caller: We were being evicted today.
[0:00:31] caller: And I just knew she wouldn't go to last another hospital stay, especially with my insurance being canceled.
[0:00:51] operator: So she's been sick?
[0:00:53] operator: Yes, very sick.
[0:00:54] operator: Okay.
[0:00:55] operator: Many, many, many times.
[0:00:57] operator: Okay.
[0:00:57] operator: Is she still breathing?
[0:00:57] operator: Is she alive?
[0:01:00] caller: I'm pretty sure she's not.
[0:01:06] operator: Okay.
[0:01:06] operator: Did you...
[0:01:07] caller: I'm sitting on the porch.
[0:01:07] caller: I'll be waiting for him.
[0:01:09] operator: The firearm is in on top of the TV.

[0:01:27] operator: And what's your phone number there?
[0:01:29] caller: Well, we had that canceled.
[0:01:31] operator: I'm calling you on my cell phone.
[0:01:33] operator: Okay, what's that number?
[0:01:33] operator: And it was just the two of you there, nobody else?
[0:01:37] operator: Nobody else.
[0:01:40] operator: And you said you wanted to come without sirens?
[0:01:43] operator: Yes, if you don't mind.
[0:01:46] operator: Okay, she knew that you were going to do this?
[0:01:46] operator: Did she ask you to?
[0:01:49] operator: No.
[0:01:50] operator: Okay, well what exactly, what happened?
[0:01:50] operator: Was she just sitting there?
[0:01:54] caller: She's laying down.
[0:01:54] caller: She's been laying down most of the time.
[0:01:58] operator: Okay, so she didn't know that you were coming?
[0:02:01] caller: No, I didn't want her to suffer anymore.
[0:02:06] operator: Was she sleeping?
[0:02:07] operator: Yes.
[0:02:13] operator: Okay, well we're getting deputies on the way to you.
[0:02:13] operator: Just stay on the phone with me, okay?
[0:02:17] operator: Okay, please tell them not to blast the sirens.
[0:02:20] caller: I understand.
[0:02:21] operator: Yes, ma'am.
[0:02:24] caller: Okay, well they're coming to help.
[0:02:26] operator: And you said she'd been sick.
[0:02:26] operator: Did you guys ever talk about her getting better or anything like that?
[0:02:33] operator: Her treatment?
[0:02:34] caller: We tried, we just done everything we could to keep her alive.
[0:02:34] caller: They said that her liver was shot.
[0:02:45] operator: Her liver was shot?
[0:02:47] caller: She's had so many strokes and seizures, hip implant, neck fusion.
[0:02:53] operator: Okay.
[0:02:56] operator: How long has she been sick?
[0:02:59] operator: Years.
[0:03:00] operator: Okay.
[0:03:01] caller: And the deputy's here.
[0:03:01] caller: I asked him not to come with that siren.
[0:03:05] operator: The deputy came without one.
[0:03:07] operator: He did come without one?
[0:03:07] operator: Is the deputy there now?
[0:03:09] caller: The deputy on the motorcycle came without one, but I hear one coming.
[0:03:13] operator: Okay.
[0:03:13] caller: Well, I did ask him not to have the sirens.
[0:03:15] operator: Is the deputy?
[0:03:15] operator: Let me know once you're with the deputy, okay?
[0:03:18] caller: I'm going to stand up until then.
[0:03:20] operator: Yes, sir.
[0:03:20] operator: Yes.
[0:03:24] operator: Yes, sir.
[0:03:25] caller: I'm on the phone with 911.
[0:03:29] operator: Okay.
[0:03:29] caller: He just asked me to hang up.
[0:03:31] operator: Okay.
[0:03:31] operator: I'll let you go then.
[0:03:33] operator: Thank you.

Name: Lorenzo Jackett, Address: 323 Roxbury Court
[0:00:00] operator: 911, do you need fire, medical or police?
[0:00:02] caller: No, ma'am, I don't.
[0:00:02] caller: I don't have an emergency.
[0:00:02] caller: Two police officers just left my house just now.
[0:00:07] caller: Can we get their names, please?
[0:00:07] caller: What's their names?
[0:00:11] caller: Just the music turned on.
[0:00:11] caller: He was the cutest cop I've seen in God knows how long.
[0:00:11] caller: I just want to know his name.
[0:00:17] caller: Sorry, I know it's not an emergency, but heck.
[0:00:21] caller: Doesn't come very often a good-looking man comes up to your doorstep.
[0:00:30] caller: Could you throw him back my way?
[0:00:30] operator: Do you need him to come back there?
[0:00:34] caller: Oh, I'd like that, yeah.
[0:00:36] operator: Why do you need him to come back there?
[0:00:38] caller: Um, because I have an emergency.
[0:00:38] caller: I'll think of something.
[0:00:44] caller: He's cute.
[0:00:45] operator: Would you throw him back, I think, at partners?
[0:00:45] operator: Throw him back my way, would you?
[0:00:45] operator: Okay, and what is the reason?
[0:00:45] operator: Um, my dog.
[0:00:53] caller: Just blame it on my dog.
[0:00:53] caller: No, say the music was too loud.
[0:00:58] operator: They came in the first place because their neighbors,
[0:01:01] caller: they've been here for over 15 years, they've got a lot of nerve, these neighbors.
[0:01:04] operator: My music was too loud, can I discuss that with them?
[0:01:04] operator: You need to talk about the noise complaint as well?
[0:01:04] operator: Exactly.
[0:01:13] operator: Hold on just a moment.
[0:01:13] operator: Thank you.
[0:01:13] operator: Yay.
[0:01:17] caller: He's a cutie pie.
[0:01:21] operator: And who ends up having the loud noise?
[0:01:26] caller: Oh, I guess I'm the one who has loud noise.
[0:01:26] caller: The officer has come to my house.
[0:01:30] operator: Kids music and workouts, loud music.
[0:01:30] operator: Okay, and ma'am, what do you need the officer to do?
[0:01:30] operator: I mean, do you have another noise complaint?
[0:01:38] caller: I guess so.
[0:01:40] operator: Okay, and where is the noise complaint?
[0:01:40] caller: Honey, I'm just going to be honest with you, okay?
[0:01:43] caller: I just thought he was cute.
[0:01:43] caller: I'm 45 years old, and I'd like to meet him again.
[0:01:43] caller: But I don't know how to go about doing that without calling 911.
[0:01:43] caller: I know this is not absolutely in any way, shape, or form an emergency.
[0:01:55] caller: But if you would give the officers my phone number and ask them to come back, other than

[0:03:38] caller: Yeah, we're coming up on Merrington Road.
[0:03:38] caller: It is a dark car, four-door, and he is still going down the road here like it's nothing.
[0:03:38] caller: It looks like a price was one day.
[0:03:38] caller: I can't tell what comes on the old
[0:03:53] operator: up Eddington.
[0:03:53] operator: Charlotte Park almost
[0:03:57] caller: at Kelly store and he is still

[0:04:09] operator: towards Danville and the other side.
[0:04:13] operator: And he slowed down a little bit,
[0:04:15] caller: but he hasn't come on the young here.
[0:04:18] operator: Kelly's market now.
[0:04:22] caller: Matt Kelly's market.
[0:04:22] caller: Yeah, he looks like he's slowing down trying to turn us.
[0:04:22] caller: What's going on?
[0:04:22] caller: It's a black corridor.
[0:04:22] caller: I mean, I can't tell, but he's
[0:04:31] operator: gonna hit somebody.

[0:04:36] caller: I'm in a green trailblazer and traffic is getting out of the way.
[0:04:36] caller: OK, I'm doing about 60 now.
[0:04:36] caller: That's what he's doing.
[0:04:36] caller: I'm on his side.
[0:04:36] caller: He's got a brake light out on the left-hand side, on the driver's side.
[0:04:36] caller: It looks like it's been broke or something because it's showing a white light back there.
[0:04:59] operator: All right.
[0:05:00] caller: We're coming up on, I guess it's Marysville Road would be to the right.
[0:05:05] operator: Or Marysville Road is to the left.

[0:05:15] operator: Yes, ma'am.
[0:05:18] caller: He should still going on like it's nothing.
[0:05:18] caller: He has got to be completely drunk, but I'm telling you he's always a rag.
[0:05:23] operator: And if it wouldn't have been a quick
[0:05:25] caller: reaction, it had been an accident.

[0:05:54] caller: I don't know these little roads.
[0:05:54] caller: I'm from this area, but I don't know these little roads.
[0:05:54] caller: East Wind, East Ward Road or something we're passing.
[0:06:02] operator: You're passing what?
[0:06:02] operator: Let me see if I can get a look at this road up here.
[0:06:08] caller: I can't see because the weather is so foggy out here.

[0:06:38] caller: I'll do my light so they'll see this crazy guy.
[0:06:56] caller: And he's actually hitting the brakes.
[0:06:56] caller: I can hear him blush his heart and he's so sweet.
[0:06:56] caller: All right, we'll pass it.
[0:07:02] caller: We're going to come to a curve here.
[0:07:02] caller: There's more traffic coming on the other side.

[0:07:17] caller: Yeah, well, we are not moving.
[0:07:17] caller: We are on the ground.
[0:07:17] caller: But just to repeat, the suspect's daughter and grandson are in the room with us, and we're doing everything we can to try and keep her calm.
[0:07:17] caller: But obviously she's distraught.
[0:07:33] caller: Absolutely, I understand.
[0:07:36] caller: But our concern is that maybe trying to get into this building, I don't know.
[0:07:43] operator: Okay.
[0:07:43] operator: How old is his daughter?
[0:07:48] caller: I don't know.
[0:07:48] caller: I don't know.
[0:07:48] caller: She's probably, I can ask her.
[0:07:56] operator: Is she an adult or is she a child?

[0:09:13] caller: I don't know.
[0:09:21] operator: Hi, is someone still on the line?
[0:09:23] caller: Yes, I'm still on the line.
[0:09:26] operator: Our assistant principal is asking that everyone go to the cafeteria, but he has not indicated that the gunman has been apprehended or subdued.
[0:09:36] caller: So I'm here a little.
[0:09:36] caller: Yeah, don't go anywhere yet.
[0:09:39] operator: One moment, okay?
[0:09:39] operator: Okay.
[0:09:39] operator: Stay on the line.

[0:10:17] operator: One moment.
[0:10:18] operator: Who was in that room with you, Mr.
[0:10:18] operator: Register?
[0:10:21] caller: I know what you're thinking, that they've asked everyone to go to the cafeteria, but they've told us to stay in here because I don't know if anyone's been subdued or apprehended and shots were fired right outside this building.
[0:10:38] operator: It's not your fault.
[0:10:38] operator: Just stay there and we need to wait to make sure the coast is clear.

[0:10:56] operator: W-A-L-L-S.
[0:10:58] operator: Okay.
[0:10:59] caller: I guess I'm highly distraught right now.
[0:10:59] caller: She doesn't know.
[0:10:59] caller: Her husband was outside when the shoot, when the, when shots were fired.

[0:11:48] caller: Our shots were definitely fired into this building, multiple shots.
[0:11:52] operator: Okay.
[0:11:53] operator: Which was the first room I called you from.
[0:11:55] caller: I'm glad I came into this room.
[0:11:57] operator: Me too.
[0:11:58] caller: Oh, my God.
[0:12:01] caller: I'm glad I came into this room.
[0:12:05] caller: Unbelievable.
[0:12:11] caller: Unbelievable.
[0:12:11] caller: I wouldn't, Ms.
[0:12:11] caller: Carey.
[0:12:23] caller: Ms.
[0:12:23] caller: Carey, I wouldn't.
[0:12:35] operator: You're doing a great job.
[0:12:38] caller: I don't feel like I'm doing much of anything.
[0:12:41] operator: Just want to know if we can, when it's safe to move.
[0:12:45] operator: Yeah, I'll let you know.
[0:12:49] operator: I'm sure just your presence there with her is calming.
[0:12:55] operator: Do you need a telephone?
[0:13:00] operator: Just a moment.
[0:13:00] operator: Okay.
[0:13:14] caller: Like I said, we're not moving, but I have to assume the scene might be somewhat secured because they have asked.
[0:13:14] caller: They made an announcement, what, about 10 minutes ago, for anybody still on campus to move towards the cafeteria.
[0:13:30] operator: Okay, yeah, definitely they want you to stay where you are for the time being, just one moment.
[0:13:34] caller: Okay, yeah, yeah, we're not moving.
[0:13:37] operator: I'm counting on you to tell us our next move.
[0:13:40] operator: Okay.
[0:13:41] caller: The shots have definitely been fired into this building.
[0:13:41] caller: Our behavior resource teacher, whose office is right next to this room, she just peeked out, and she says, you know, there's at least a couple bullet holes in her windows.
[0:13:57] operator: Okay.
[0:13:57] caller: And that was the building that I was, I mean, that's the room that I had initially called from 911.
[0:14:03] operator: Was it you that I talked to?
[0:14:05] caller: Yes, it was.
[0:14:06] caller: Okay, because I had a real bad connection, which was probably part of the problem you were having.
[0:14:06] caller: That's why you were breaking up on me, so I don't know how much of what I was saying you could hear.
[0:14:18] caller: Yeah, we had some kind of beeping on the line at that time.
[0:14:18] caller: I don't know what it was.
[0:14:20] caller: Yeah, but just to clarify, the room that I originally called 911 from, we're in the room next door right now.
[0:14:20] caller: There's only one window in here, and I'm right under it.
[0:14:34] caller: But lots of windows in the other room.
[0:14:34] caller: That's why I kind of transitioned into here, and that's where shots were fired.
[0:14:47] operator: And that's in the office of the building you're in right now, correct?
[0:14:51] caller: Come back, I'm sorry, what?
[0:14:52] operator: The bullet holes that you're speaking of were in the office of the building that you are in right now?
[0:14:57] caller: Yeah, they were into this building, not the room that we are in right now.
[0:14:57] caller: There's about five different rooms in this building, approximately.
[0:14:57] caller: Yeah, there's one, two, three, four, five.
[0:14:57] caller: We are in a, no, there's six rooms in this building, but we are in a different room.
[0:14:57] caller: The shots were definitely fired.
[0:14:57] caller: Yeah, we heard shots right outside the building.
[0:14:57] caller: We saw a blast flying, and that's when we shut the door to this room.
[0:15:23] operator: Okay.
[0:15:35] operator: This did not need to go down.
[0:15:37] caller: Well, not that it ever does.
[0:15:51] operator: Ms.
[0:15:51] operator: Register?
[0:15:51] operator: Is Chase on campus?
[0:15:55] operator: Huh?
[0:15:57] caller: But he is on campus?
[0:16:00] operator: Okay.
[0:16:00] operator: Okay.
[0:16:04] caller: Ma'am?
[0:16:06] operator: Yes?
[0:16:06] caller: We also have a teacher in our room with us whose son attends school here.
[0:16:06] caller: She's not sure if he's on campus.
[0:16:06] caller: this.
[0:16:06] caller: So, just we got a lot of nervous people in here, so please let us know as soon as it's safe to move.
[0:16:23] caller: Yes, sir.
[0:16:23] caller: I understand.
[0:16:23] caller: One moment.
[0:16:23] caller: One moment.
[0:16:37] operator: Do we know anyone else in the building this morning besides Ms.
[0:16:37] operator: Caring?
[0:16:45] caller: That's something.
[0:16:45] caller: It's only a few down.
[0:16:45] caller: Chunks have changed.
[0:16:53] operator: Oh, gosh.
[0:16:54] caller: It's going in.
[0:16:57] operator: You're in the school resources building, correct?
[0:17:00] operator: Student services is the name of the building.
[0:17:00] operator: Student services.
[0:17:00] operator: It is building three if someone has a map of campus.
[0:17:08] caller: It is building three.
[0:17:10] operator: Okay.
[0:17:10] caller: I don't know if that helps.
[0:17:10] caller: But we're, yes, we're smack dab in the middle of campus.
[0:17:17] operator: Okay.
[0:17:21] operator: As soon as they've got it fully secure, they're going to be coming to you.
[0:17:23] caller: They don't want you guys to move.
[0:17:25] operator: Okay.
[0:17:25] operator: Okay?
[0:17:26] caller: Yeah, I mean, that's fine.
[0:17:26] caller: As long as it's law enforcement coming to us, we're fine with that.
[0:17:34] operator: Absolutely, absolutely.
[0:17:49] operator: Would you be at liberty to share with us if anyone was shot or wounded on campus?
[0:17:57] caller: I'm not, but I honestly don't know any of that yet because it's all on silent lines right now in traffic.
[0:18:06] caller: So our only concern right now.
[0:18:08] caller: I understand.
[0:18:08] operator: Our dispatching is separate from our call taking.
[0:18:11] caller: We're all in the same building, but we don't hear the radio traffic from where I'm sitting.
[0:18:17] operator: So I get my updates directly from dispatch.
[0:18:17] operator: Yeah.
[0:18:21] caller: I have a student on the line again, and he's present with the suspect's daughter and grandson and a few other people, and they're all in this student resources building.
[0:18:34] operator: Student services.

[0:18:34] operator: It is safe to get up.
[0:18:34] operator: The scene is secure.
[0:18:34] operator: But they do want you to stay where you're at.
[0:18:34] operator: They're going to come to you.
[0:18:34] operator: All of you.
[0:18:34] operator: Okay?
[0:18:53] caller: The scene is secure.
[0:18:53] caller: We can stand up and stay in the building.
[0:18:57] operator: Yes, sir.
[0:18:57] operator: And is the teacher there that's present with them that wants to check on her child?
[0:18:57] operator: Can she leave the building?
[0:19:02] operator: All the children are safe.
[0:19:02] operator: They need to stay where they're at.

[0:19:11] operator: Okay, hang on.
[0:19:14] caller: I think there may be law enforcement at the door.
[0:19:17] operator: Okay.
[0:19:17] operator: Okay.
[0:19:17] operator: Do you still need us?
[0:19:22] caller: We've got a lot of sheriff's officers in here with the suspect's daughter.
[0:19:28] operator: Can I let you go now, ma'am?
[0:19:30] operator: One moment.
[0:19:31] caller: Sorry, it's hard holding the phone when you're at the jump out of your chest.
[0:19:31] caller: I know.
[0:19:35] operator: Yes, you can.
[0:19:35] operator: You can go ahead and let me go.
[0:19:35] operator: They do know where you are.
[0:19:35] operator: And as soon as they get done searching the entire building and making sure everything's clear, they're going to come see where you guys are.
[0:19:35] operator: But make sure no one leaves.
[0:19:35] operator: Just make sure they don't see where you guys are right now.
[0:19:47] caller: We'll do.
[0:19:47] caller: We'll do.

[0:06:02] caller: I stayed in the basement and my brother ran upstairs.
[0:06:02] caller: I heard something loud and I told him to go help because I heard screaming.
[0:06:13] operator: Okay, so you're the daughter, and you said you were in the basement and heard noises?

[0:07:07] operator: Nobody saw them?
[0:07:07] operator: Do we know where the weapon was that was used?
[0:07:10] caller: No, because my brother and I were downstairs, and I just heard people yelling and screaming upstairs.
[0:07:10] caller: And I told my brother to go upstairs to see what was going on, and I'm guessing they were gone because my brother is trying to help myself.
[0:07:27] operator: So you told your brother to go upstairs and help when you heard screaming?
[0:07:30] caller: I heard screaming and I ran to the couch and I said, go help, go help, because I heard screaming and my brother ran upstairs.
[0:07:39] operator: What's your brother's job, right?
[0:07:41] operator: Yes.
[0:07:42] operator: Jeff went upstairs and what happened?
[0:07:45] caller: I'm assuming he called you and he just told me to stay down here and I said, and then he had to phone me and he said, oh, I'm wondering.
[0:07:58] operator: Are you in the basement still?
[0:07:58] operator: What floor of the house are you on?
[0:08:01] caller: I'm in the basement.

[0:08:04] operator: Yes.
[0:08:04] operator: Okay.
[0:08:06] operator: And how many floors is the house?
[0:08:09] caller: There's the basement and then the main floor and then the upstairs.
[0:08:12] operator: Okay.
[0:08:12] operator: There should be a Yale officer outside, okay?
[0:08:16] operator: My brother should be here.
[0:08:18] caller: I understand.
[0:08:18] operator: Do you know any injuries or anything that's wrong with your mother?

[0:08:34] caller: I just heard yelling and then footsteps running down the stairs, a bunch of footsteps running down the stairs.
[0:08:34] caller: And then when the stairs were higher, my dad comes down, and now they're yelling, hurry, hurry, I'm really scared.
[0:08:49] operator: Okay, and you did not see anything that happened?
[0:08:52] caller: No, because we were both in the basement.
[0:08:54] operator: Do you know who was in the house with your parents?
[0:08:57] caller: No, nobody was supposed to be in the house.
[0:09:00] operator: Nobody was supposed to be in the house with your parents?

[0:09:14] operator: I want you to stay on the phone with me until you see the officer, okay?
[0:09:19] operator: I have to go upstairs?
[0:09:21] operator: No, you can stay in the basement if you are not comfortable going upstairs.
[0:09:21] operator: Is anybody else in the basement with you?
[0:09:26] caller: No, I'm just by myself.

[0:10:03] caller: I don't know anything else.
[0:10:03] caller: I hear
[0:10:09] caller: footsteps upstairs, so I'm assuming they're doing something that I'm not going to do.
[0:10:09] caller: Okay.
[0:10:17] caller: I'm okay.
[0:10:17] caller: Just stay in the line with me, okay?
[0:10:17] caller: We do have an officer on scene.
[0:10:17] caller: We're just trying
[0:10:24] operator: to get more information, okay?
[0:10:24] operator: What's that?
[0:10:24] operator: My neighbor just came down here.
[0:10:24] operator: Your neighbor came
[0:10:31] operator: Okay, does your neighbor have any information for us at all?
[0:10:31] operator: Can I talk to your neighbor?
[0:10:35] caller: I think he's calling someone right now on the other phone.
[0:10:39] operator: Okay, just stay in the line with me if you can think of any more information.
[0:10:39] operator: So what you're saying is that your parents were alone upstairs, you and your brother were downstairs, and there was nobody else in the house?
[0:10:48] caller: There wasn't supposed to be anybody in the house.
[0:10:50] operator: Okay, and then all of a sudden you just heard yelling, and that's when you got scared and told your brother to go upstairs?
[0:10:55] operator: Yes.
[0:10:56] operator: Okay.
[0:10:56] operator: And did your brother come back down at all, or how did you know what happened?
[0:10:56] operator: He told me I needed to talk to you.
[0:10:56] operator: Okay, he handed the phone and you saw him covered in blood, okay.
[0:11:10] operator: Now, what you're saying is that your brother was downstairs with you the whole time until you made him go upstairs?
[0:11:16] caller: I heard loud, loud footsteps of my dad screaming, and then I yelled to my brother because I was on one side of the basement and he was on the other, and I just yelled, help, help, go help him because I didn't know what he was doing.
[0:11:30] caller: Yep, absolutely.
[0:11:36] operator: And did your brother say anything to you when he came back down or handed you the phone?

[0:01:13] caller: That's right.
[0:01:13] caller: Why don't we try to do that, though?

[0:01:18] operator: Let me know when you're with her.
[0:01:18] operator: Hang on.
[0:01:20] operator: Okay.

[0:07:20] operator: Okay.
[0:07:20] caller: She called her husband, Kevin.
[0:07:26] operator: And there is really no need for us to continue this.

[0:02:55] caller: Okay, I do not want them to press down firmly.
[0:03:00] operator: Do not lift up the loop.

[0:03:10] caller: That's right.
[0:03:10] caller: He's wrapping that one around now, and then he's going to hold it.

[0:15:43] operator: Would you be willing to try to get a little bit closer so at least we can tell?
[0:15:48] caller: I mean, he might just be shot in the ankle.
[0:15:50] operator: Do you know what I'm saying?

[0:18:19] caller: I'm not sure because it had, I mean, it just had happened in the back road.
[0:18:27] operator: Okay.
[0:18:27] caller: I'm not sure which way it went.
[0:18:30] operator: You said it was a pickup truck?
[0:18:33] caller: I think it was a pickup truck.
[0:18:35] operator: Okay.
[0:18:41] operator: Okay.
[0:18:44] operator: You said there was no tent?
[0:18:51] caller: I think it was a tent.
[0:18:51] caller: It's pretty dark back here.
[0:18:56] operator: Okay.
[0:18:56] operator: Okay, would you be willing to meet with a deputy?
[0:19:01] caller: I don't know.
[0:19:01] caller: I don't think I'm ready to say.
[0:19:04] operator: They just need to get information about what you might have seen, so that way they can find this guy.
[0:19:04] operator: It's really important if you'd be willing to meet with a deputy.
[0:19:04] operator: It would be really, really helpful.
[0:19:16] caller: I had to force myself to tell y'all this had happened.
[0:19:16] caller: I know, and I do appreciate it.
[0:19:22] operator: We can get this information.
[0:19:22] operator: We do need to get this information from you though, so anything that you could possibly tell a deputy just so that way you can tell them what they saw or what you saw.
[0:19:39] caller: I don't know, I'm not sure.
[0:19:43] operator: They're not going to do anything about you.
[0:19:43] operator: They're not going to give out your information.
[0:19:43] operator: They're not going to give your...
[0:19:50] caller: They're not going to disclose anything.
[0:19:52] operator: anything about you.
[0:19:52] operator: It's just what we need for us so that way we can get whatever you saw.
[0:20:00] operator: I know.
[0:20:00] operator: I know.
[0:20:00] operator: What's your name, sir?
[0:20:11] operator: Sir, may I have your name?
[0:20:20] operator: If you don't want to meet with the deputy, can we have a deputy call you?
[0:20:26] operator: We have your phone number already, so we can have...
[0:20:26] operator: What's your name, sir?
[0:20:36] operator: What's your name?
[0:20:38] operator: I guess...
[0:20:41] caller: There's a lot of pressure right here.
[0:20:43] operator: I know, and you can trust me.
[0:20:43] operator: I would not be telling you this information if it wasn't true.
[0:20:43] operator: No one's going to know you talked to a deputy.
[0:20:43] operator: It's going to come up as an unknown number on your phone,
[0:20:56] caller: so no one's even going to be able to see that.
[0:20:58] operator: We're not going to give any of your information out.
[0:20:58] operator: It's just really, really important in a situation like this
[0:21:04] operator: that anyone that has any information about it can give that information to the deputies.
[0:21:04] operator: We're not trying to get you in trouble or anything like that.
[0:21:04] operator: or make it look like you, you know, did something that isn't what you want to do.
[0:21:19] caller: It's just really important.
[0:21:27] caller: It's a lot, man.
[0:21:29] caller: I know.
[0:21:29] caller: I know it's a lot.
[0:21:29] caller: But all I need is that last name.
[0:21:34] caller: Yeah, if not, we're just going to get it to the phone.
[0:21:40] operator: Y'all can call me back.
[0:21:44] caller: Yeah, I was on that.
[0:21:45] operator: Okay, so you said you don't know which way he was going?
[0:21:45] operator: Do you know which road he was on?
[0:21:51] caller: It was the back track.
[0:21:51] caller: He took one of the roads off his back track.
[0:21:57] caller: He could have went any way.
[0:21:57] caller: He could have went down.
[0:21:59] operator: Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[0:21:59] operator: He took what off of his backpack?
[0:22:03] caller: It was the back road.
[0:22:03] caller: You know, it's the back road.
[0:22:05] operator: Oh, he took a back road?
[0:22:08] operator: Yeah.
[0:22:08] operator: Was it on OBT towards something, or was he on Holden?
[0:22:14] operator: Um...
[0:22:17] operator: But you said it happened at the intersection.
[0:22:21] caller: No, it was the back set that had it.
[0:22:26] operator: A back road off of Holden or off of OBT?
[0:22:31] operator: No, you know the Save-A-Lot stop, right?
[0:22:31] operator: Uh-huh, so was it behind the Save-A-Lot?
[0:22:31] operator: Yeah, behind, uh-huh.
[0:22:31] operator: So did he come out on Rio Grande?
[0:22:31] operator: So did he come out on Rio Grande or?
[0:22:47] caller: No, I'm not too sure.
[0:22:47] caller: I couldn't see from that view.
[0:22:55] operator: Okay.
[0:22:55] operator: And did you see anything about the driver?

[0:23:14] operator: Call me back.
[0:23:18] operator: Okay, sir, just stay on the phone with me for a little bit longer.
[0:23:18] operator: You know, I know you said did he look like he was older, younger, white, black?
[0:23:18] operator: Any information at all would be helpful.

OPERATOR: Okay. I want to help you as much as I can. Whatever you need to tell me...
CALLER: No, I did what I did. People are dead. It's a criminal act, I committed a crime.
OPERATOR: We don't know that. We might be able to help them still.
CALLER: People are dead.
OPERATOR: Okay. I'm trying to help you.
CALLER: Multiple repeated crimes, child abuse, stuff like that.

CALLER: Yes, you do.

CALLER: Would you do me a favor?
OPERATOR: What's up?
CALLER: Don't tell them to come up here with lights and sirens because I don't want people to know what I've done.

CALLER: She was all cursing in her head and I had to do it.
CALLER: God, don't hurt me when you come out.
OPERATOR: Okay. Because you did shoot your wife, there are several officers coming in first. They're going to make contact with you, and they may have their guns drawn. Make sure that you don't make any sudden moves and that you're very cooperative with them. Be as open with them as you have been with me.

OPERATOR: Just stay on the phone with me until they get there, all right?
CALLER: My heart is beating fast now. I should have shot myself, too.
OPERATOR: Oh, no. Okay, well, all I can say is try to take a deep breath and relax. I know this is a very stressful time for you right now.

CALLER: Yes, we have shots fired at the Bank of America. There are two suspects, heavily armed and wearing body armor.
OPERATOR: Are you or anyone else with you injured?
CALLER: I believe there are officers down. The suspects are armed with AK-47s and are shooting at everything.
OPERATOR: Stay calm. Units are responding code 3. Can you see the suspects' location now?
CALLER: One suspect is outside the bank, moving toward the parking lot. The other might still be inside.
OPERATOR: Keep at a safe distance. Officers are en route. Do not approach the suspects.
CALLER: I can see the suspect's vehicle. It's a white car with an open trunk, parked near the north side of the bank.
OPERATOR: Noted. We need to keep the area clear. Where exactly are you now?
CALLER: I'm behind a tree, north of Archwood on Laurel Canyon. I can see more civilians getting caught in the crossfire.
OPERATOR: Keep yourself covered and away from the line of fire. Multiple units are en route. We'll get help to you soon.
CALLER: Understood. They're still firing at the officers. One suspect is now moving eastbound, out of the parking lot.
OPERATOR: Alright. The air unit has eyes on them. We need all units to maintain a safe distance and allow SWAT to handle the suspects.
CALLER: Can we get more help? There are injured officers and civilians.
OPERATOR: Ambulances are on standby, and additional units are being notified. We need to keep the area secure.
CALLER: The officers are pinned down, and one suspect is still shooting at them from behind the white vehicle.
OPERATOR: Noted. SWAT is being notified. All units maintain your positions until SWAT arrives.
CALLER: The suspect with the white vehicle is moving again, heading east on Archwood.
OPERATOR: Units, keep a safe distance and follow the suspect. The air unit will provide updates on the suspect's movements.
CALLER: Alright, they're still firing. This is chaotic. Civilians are in danger.
OPERATOR: All units, shots are still being fired. Civilians are in danger. Maintain distance. Help is on the way.
CALLER: One suspect is trying to escape. We need to secure the area.
OPERATOR: All units, suspect attempting to flee. Secure the perimeter and avoid engagement until SWAT arrives.
CALLER: Understood. We'll hold positions.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: My friend has been missing since 7 o'clock this morning. She's in the middle of a divorce, and I'm not sure what to do.
OPERATOR: Can you give me some more details about why you believe she's missing?
CALLER: She supposedly went for a run this morning at 7 o'clock in Lockmere, but no one has heard from her. She was supposed to be at my house at 8, and she never showed up.
OPERATOR: Have you checked with any local hospitals or anyone she might have contacted?
CALLER: I called Wake Med, and they haven't admitted her on any emergent basis.
OPERATOR: Okay. Just a moment. May I place you on hold for just a moment?
CALLER: Yep.
OPERATOR: Thank you. That's correct. All right. What is your friend's name?
CALLER: Her name is Nancy Cooper.
OPERATOR: What is her address?
CALLER: She and her husband live together, but they are in the middle of a divorce.
OPERATOR: Have you tried making contact with her?
CALLER: Yes, I called her husband this morning around 9. He said she went for a run with her friend Carrie, but she hasn't returned. I'm worried because it's not like her to disappear like this.
OPERATOR: Has her husband been violent with her in the past?
CALLER: I'm not sure if he's been physically violent, but I know there's been a lot of tension.
OPERATOR: Is it possible she might have done something else and just forgotten to inform anyone?
CALLER: Her car is parked at home and her cell phone is there, so it seems like she did leave for a run. It's not like her to just vanish without letting anyone know.
OPERATOR: Did her husband mention anything about her running with someone else?
CALLER: Yes, he said she was running with a friend named Carrie, but none of her other friends or I knew anything about it. It's very odd.
OPERATOR: What can the police department do to help in this situation?
CALLER: I'm not sure what to do. Should her husband be the one to file a report? Is there a certain number of hours we need to wait?
OPERATOR: There is no time limit to file a missing person report. The person who last saw her should file it, which in this case would be her husband.
CALLER: Okay. I'm just worried about how her husband will react.
OPERATOR: It's better to be safe than sorry. We will send an officer to her house to speak with her husband and check the area.
CALLER: Thank you. Her husband contacted me directly to explain the situation.
OPERATOR: We will also check the trails around Lockmere Lake. Can you describe the trails she might have taken?
CALLER: Yes, they're public trails, but some parts are more secluded. I've run with her there before.
OPERATOR: Alright, give us about 30 to 45 minutes to work on this. You can call me back after that.
CALLER: Okay. My name is Michelle.
OPERATOR: Thank you, Michelle. We'll do everything we can.
CALLER: Thank you. Bye.
OPERATOR: Goodbye.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: I need a policeman in the name of this in my house. Right now.
OPERATOR: I need you to calm down and give me the address, ma'am.
CALLER: 1807 Elmwood Court, Sugarland, hurry, please.
OPERATOR: What's going on, ma'am?
CALLER: She's trying to get away. She's trying to get away. Please send somebody.
OPERATOR: Okay, I need you to tell me why. What's going on?
CALLER: My husband pressed charges against her, and now she busted the door off and stabbed him. Please hurry up.
OPERATOR: She came into your house and stabbed him? Who is she?
CALLER: Please just send somebody.
OPERATOR: Okay, he's holding her down at this point, but he's bleeding very badly.
CALLER: Yes, and he's trying to hold her down, but she said she's not going to jail, so she's stabbing him.
OPERATOR: Ma'am, I have them on the way. What is the female's name you're talking about?
CALLER: Her name is Lydia. Okay, right now he's trying to hold her down and she's... oh, God!
OPERATOR: What is she stabbing him with?
CALLER: I don't know. It's not... it looks like a knife. It's sticking out of his head.
OPERATOR: A knife?
CALLER: Yes, I just don't stick it out of his head. It's still in there.
OPERATOR: Okay, what's your name, ma'am?
CALLER: My name is Cindy, and I'm sorry, but I am really freaked out right now.
OPERATOR: Okay, I understand, ma'am, and I'm sorry, but they're on the way, okay? Who is she to you all?
CALLER: She used to work for him. She stole a lot of equipment, so he pressed charges on her, and now all of a sudden she's in our house in the middle of the night.
OPERATOR: Does she have a car, anything out there you know?
CALLER: I don't know.
OPERATOR: Do you have any kids or anything over there?
CALLER: Yes, I have four.
OPERATOR: You have four kids inside?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Are your kids in another room?
CALLER: Yes, they're upstairs asleep. Please hurry, let's hurry up.
OPERATOR: Try to calm down, ma'am. They're on the way. They're coming as fast as they can.
CALLER: I'm going to wind up killing her if she doesn't just be still. Okay, I'm gonna hit her with this baseball bat if she doesn't be still.
OPERATOR: Ma'am, just keep her there one way or another. She's not getting away this time.
CALLER: This is the problem. They couldn't find her. The police are supposed to be arresting her for the last month.
OPERATOR: You said your husband filed a restraining order on her before?
CALLER: He does, possibly. He had a warrant out for her arrest, but as usual, the police aren't doing their job.
OPERATOR: Ma'am, you need to get that ambulance here quick. Okay, he's bleeding everywhere.
CALLER: He's bleeding everywhere.
OPERATOR: Where did she stab him?
CALLER: In the head. I've already told you that.
OPERATOR: Okay, I have that, but you said she was continuing to stab him.
CALLER: That's all I can see right now.
OPERATOR: Where are you all at in the house?
CALLER: We're in the bedroom.
OPERATOR: In the bedroom? Is the door open or anything?
CALLER: I was standing in the doorway. I don't remember if I left it open or not.
OPERATOR: Ma'am, can I please get off the phone now?
CALLER: I have a bat, ma'am. If I have to, I will use it.
OPERATOR: Okay, stay on the line. They should be coming soon, okay?
CALLER: Okay, he's doing all he can to hold her down. If she moves, I'm going to hit her.
OPERATOR: Okay, they should be coming any minute now.
CALLER: Hurry, please, hurry!
OPERATOR: Okay, ma'am, where is your bedroom located in the house? They come in the door, where do they go?
CALLER: To the left, in the back.
CALLER: Hurry, please, hurry! She's running.
OPERATOR: They should be coming up, ma'am. Hold on for me.
CALLER: Are you okay? They're here!
OPERATOR: You have an officer there?
CALLER: Yes, they're here. We need an ambulance.
OPERATOR: Okay, they're coming. Stay safe.
CALLER: Okay, bye.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: I've got a woman in my bank pointing a rifle at all of us and all of our customers. I need police now.
OPERATOR: Okay, stay on the line with me. It's a woman, you said?
CALLER: Oh my God, she's making us go into the vault. I need police here now!
OPERATOR: Police are on the way. Stay on the line with me. A woman is holding up the bank?
CALLER: Yes, she just walked in with a shotgun.
OPERATOR: Okay, which bank and where exactly is it located?
CALLER: Bank of America on the corner of Orangewood Avenue and Central Florida Parkway.
OPERATOR: Where are you right now?
CALLER: I just walked out to my car.
OPERATOR: Can you describe the woman for me?
CALLER: Yes, she's white, has brown hair, wearing a pink tank top and blue jean shorts.
OPERATOR: Okay, and you said you saw a shotgun?
CALLER: Yes, ma'am. I'm moving down the road a little bit, but I can still see the bank.
OPERATOR: Please try to stay where you can see the bank safely. Your name?
CALLER: Okay, hang on. My name is [Name Redacted].
OPERATOR: Okay. Can you see anything else?
CALLER: No, ma'am.
OPERATOR: Do you know what she was wearing?
CALLER: A pink shirt, blue jean shorts.
OPERATOR: Okay. Where are you right now?
CALLER: I moved down to a public area so I wouldn't be in full view of her. I thought it was a joke at first, but then she said it was a stick-up.
OPERATOR: You were walking out as she was walking in?
CALLER: Correct. She said everyone had to give her money, but I was already out the door.
OPERATOR: Okay, stay on the line. Let me see if I can transfer you to my dispatcher.
CALLER: No problem.
OPERATOR: Okay, stay on the line. What's your emergency?
CALLER: Hey, I don't know if this is real, but I'm standing outside the Bank of America on the corner of Orangewood and Central Florida Parkway. There's a lady with a rifle and she's bringing people into the vault. I just walked in and she told me to turn around and get out, so I did.
OPERATOR: Yes, we have deputies on the way. Can you describe the woman?
CALLER: She was Hispanic and around 45 years old.
OPERATOR: What was she wearing?
CALLER: An orange shirt, like a halter top, and black jeans, I think.
OPERATOR: Do you know what type of rifle it was?
CALLER: No, but it was definitely a rifle.
OPERATOR: She was putting everyone inside the vault?
CALLER: Yes, I saw her directing people into the vault.
OPERATOR: Can you still see her? Are you in the parking lot?
CALLER: I'm in the parking lot but I can't see inside the bank from here.
OPERATOR: Has she exited the bank yet, as far as you can tell?
CALLER: No, she hasn't. She's still inside.
OPERATOR: Okay, stay where you are and keep safe. We'll have officers there shortly.
CALLER: Okay, thank you.

CALLER: Oh, my God, he's shooting again!
OPERATOR: All right, who is he shooting at?
CALLER: I don't know! He's shooting at my girlfriend's daughter.
OPERATOR: Hold on one second. Does she have a restraining order against him?
CALLER: Yes, she has a restraining order against him, and he won't leave us alone. Oh, please, hurry!
OPERATOR: All right, 19 Windham Court in Arlington Heights, right?

OPERATOR: Is anyone hurt?

CALLER: Yes, somebody's in the back and on my porch.
OPERATOR: Someone's on your porch? Please stay calm. Can you see anybody?
CALLER: I hear them, but I'm not sure. Somebody's banging on my back door.

CALLER: No.
OPERATOR: Okay. There's no vehicle outside in your driveway?
CALLER: No, and they're at my back porch.
OPERATOR: Okay, I'm going to stay on the phone with you until the officers get there. Do not hang up. A lot of officers are coming out.

OPERATOR: It doesn't make sense with a car and locked gates, right?
CALLER: Yes, he was banging and trying to get in. I heard him outside.
OPERATOR: Okay. The officers are on their way. Please stay calm.
CALLER: Please get someone here quickly.
OPERATOR: They're coming as fast as they can. Are you hurt at all?
CALLER: My face is bleeding. He was beating on me when he found out I was in here. That's why I dropped the phone and almost dropped the gun.

OPERATOR: Okay. Does the child need medical attention?
CALLER: No. He has some marks on his forehead, but the cat, we don't know what to do about the cat. He's trying to attack us. He's very, very hostile. I tried to get hold of animal control.

CALLER: It's between Sand Lane and you have to take Highland Boulevard, make a right on Fingerboard and a right on Columbia.
OPERATOR: Okay, ma'am, are you sure the building number is 850?
CALLER: Am I sure? It's 850. That's the school. They have to go past the school, go around, make the right on Fingerboard and right on Columbia, but please hurry because it's urgent.
OPERATOR: Okay, that range number is not appropriate for me, so can you give me the cross streets?
CALLER: Highland Boulevard between what and what?
OPERATOR: Are you inside the location that's on fire, ma'am?
CALLER: No, but please hurry.
OPERATOR: Ma'am, tell me Highland Boulevard between what and what?
CALLER: Highland Boulevard and it's on Sand Lane and you have to go. It's Highland Boulevard. Please hurry.
OPERATOR: Ma'am, is there someone else there I could speak to?
CALLER: No, I think I'm the only one in the house because we just moved.
OPERATOR: Okay, ma'am. I need you to relax so I can get some help there. It's Highland Boulevard, Sand Lane, and what?
CALLER: No, not Sand Lane. Highland Boulevard. You have to pass 850 Highland Boulevard, make a right on Fingerboard and a right on Columbia.
OPERATOR: Is that West Fingerboard Road?
CALLER: No, Fingerboard and then a right on Columbia. This is Staten Island.
OPERATOR: Can you verify the information? What's the address?
CALLER: 850, Highland Boulevard. Go past 850 Highland Boulevard, make a right on Fingerboard and a right on Columbia, and then come straight up into our property.
OPERATOR: Okay, what's the emergency there?
CALLER: There's a fire in our house. We built a new house and the old house is on fire.

CALLER: Yes, I had a baby. They were sleeping. She was choking on her vomit, and I don't know what's going on.
OPERATOR: Is she awake?
CALLER: No, me and my daughter are here. I'm trying to help, but I really don't know what I'm doing.
OPERATOR: Okay, I can give you instructions. What I need you to do is lay her on her back.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Put one hand underneath her back and tilt her head slightly back to open the airway.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Is she breathing softly?
CALLER: I can hear her heart, but I'm not sure if she's breathing.
OPERATOR: Check if she has a pulse.
CALLER: Yes, she has a pulse, but she's not waking up.
OPERATOR: Ma'am, I need you to calm down and tell me if she's breathing.
CALLER: I don't know. All the vomit is out of her mouth.
OPERATOR: Okay, I need you to roll her onto her side and tap her back gently to make sure the airway is clear.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Now put your mouth over her nose and mouth, give her two breaths, and make sure her chest rises.
CALLER: Okay, it did. Her chest rose.
OPERATOR: Is she breathing on her own now?
CALLER: Yes, she is.
OPERATOR: Alright, the officer should be on the scene soon. Do you hear them?
CALLER: I hear him.
OPERATOR: Okay, I'm going to let you go now. You're doing great.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: Yeah, we need somebody at the Center Middle School gym.
OPERATOR: What's going on there?
CALLER: We have an athlete who is on the court, moaning on his back. Could be dehydrated, could be having a seizure.
OPERATOR: This is at the high school?
CALLER: No, this is at the middle school.
OPERATOR: And it's called the Center Middle School?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Do you know the actual address there, sir?
CALLER: Hey, does anybody know the address here? 700 East 4th Street.
OPERATOR: And this is in the gym?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: And your name?
CALLER: Greg Hall.
OPERATOR: Okay, so tell me exactly what happened.
CALLER: We had basketball tryouts today, the first day of tryouts, and at the end of practice, he just collapsed on the ground.
OPERATOR: Okay, and are you with him now?
CALLER: They're on the way, right? Yeah. They're on the way, sir.
OPERATOR: Are you with the patient now?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: How old is he?
CALLER: He is 13 or 14 years old.
OPERATOR: Is he awake?
CALLER: They're on their way here, guys. He's awake, but barely.
OPERATOR: Is he breathing?
CALLER: Is he breathing, Mike? Very erratic.
OPERATOR: Okay. And so he just collapsed, like he fainted almost?
CALLER: Almost, yeah.
OPERATOR: Is he breathing completely normal?
CALLER: I'm sorry, sir. Is he breathing completely normal? No, he is not. His eyes are rolled back a bit.
OPERATOR: Okay. Is he changing color?
CALLER: Yes. Mike, what do you say? He's changing color. Flip. Yeah.
OPERATOR: What color?
CALLER: They're starting to go blue a little bit.
OPERATOR: Does he have a history of heart problems that you're aware of?
CALLER: We don't know. Nobody's aware of heart problems with this guy, right? No. He's a first-year player. He should have passed a physical, too.
OPERATOR: Okay. Is there a defibrillator on site and ready to use?
CALLER: Yes, there is a defibrillator.
OPERATOR: Okay. Have someone grab that in case we need it later. Now, you said he is not alert. Is he conscious or unconscious?
CALLER: What do you say, is he conscious or unconscious, Mike? He's semi-conscious.
OPERATOR: Okay. We're getting no movement. What I want you to do is get him flat on his back, nothing under his head.
CALLER: Okay. Yeah, that's where he's at now.
OPERATOR: Okay. I want you to kneel next to him, look in his mouth. Is there any food or vomit?
CALLER: Look in his mouth. Is there food or vomit? There's nothing. No, there isn't.
OPERATOR: Is he breathing?
CALLER: No. He has stopped breathing.
OPERATOR: Okay. Place your hand on his forehead. Your other hand under his neck, then tilt his head back.
CALLER: Yep, it's back.
OPERATOR: Now I want you to put your ear next to his mouth. Can you feel or hear any breathing?
CALLER: No.
OPERATOR: Okay. I'm going to tell you how to give mouth to mouth.
CALLER: Okay, mouth to mouth. Go ahead.
OPERATOR: If you're trained in CPR, you can certainly perform CPR.
CALLER: Okay. Yep, we're doing it now.
OPERATOR: Okay, so you're doing that now?
CALLER: Yep, we're doing it now.
OPERATOR: Do you have the defibrillator?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Okay, I want you to put the defibrillator on the floor next to his head, on the side closest to you.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Now you want to remove his shirt.
CALLER: Now we have it pulled up. Do we need to remove it or can we just pull it up?
OPERATOR: As long as you've got his bare chest.
CALLER: Okay. We've got fluid coming out of his mouth. We turned him to the side.
OPERATOR: Clean out his mouth.
CALLER: Is there someone there that can open the AED and get it set up?
OPERATOR: Yes, we have three people here.
CALLER: Do you have paramedics there now?
OPERATOR: No, not yet.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Are the pads already plugged into the machine, sir?
CALLER: No.
OPERATOR: Okay, someone needs to install the pads, plug the pads in. There should be instructions as part of the machine.
CALLER: Okay. We're working on it. Can somebody help me out with the pads, you guys? We got CPR going on. We need to get the pads and stuff.
OPERATOR: The engine is getting really close.
CALLER: What do they need out of here to use?
OPERATOR: The pads should usually be in a flat foil or plastic package.
CALLER: Can't see the pads? Yeah, if they're not plugged in, they're usually in a foil package or some sort of plastic package.
OPERATOR: It could be underneath the unit itself.
CALLER: I'm doing my best. I am. Do you find them? We're looking. We've got tons of fluid coming out.
OPERATOR: Tilt his head to the side and clean out the fluid in his mouth.
CALLER: We're doing that as much as we can.
OPERATOR: You got the ETA on these guys?
OPERATOR: The engine is pulling up now, but you need to keep working on him.
CALLER: Here they are, guys. Here they are.
CALLER: Okay, they're here now.
OPERATOR: Okay, I'll let you go. Thank you.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: I need medical.
OPERATOR: Okay, where are you?
CALLER: I'm in UCF, Lake Claire, building 57, third floor, room 311.
CALLER: My friend was drinking, and she woke me up, and she's sick, and now she's not responding. Her eyes were just open, now they're closed.
OPERATOR: Ma'am, hold on one second. I'm going to transfer you over to the medical department. Do not hang up, okay?
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Okay, you're at building 57 at UCF?
CALLER: Yes, Building 57, room 311 at Lake Claire Apartments on campus.
OPERATOR: Okay, and your friend is not responding now?
CALLER: No, she's not. She's purple and clammy and told me her heart hurt.
OPERATOR: All right, listen to me. You need to lay her down flat, okay? Take any pillows or anything out from underneath her head.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Put one hand on her forehead and one hand under her neck, and tilt her head back. See if that helps with her breathing. How old is she?
CALLER: She's 18 years old. She's unconscious and not breathing.
OPERATOR: Okay, put your ear close to her mouth and look at her chest to see if you hear or feel any breathing.
CALLER: I don't hear or feel anything. Her chest isn't rising.
OPERATOR: Okay, we need to help her. Are you able to give her some breaths until help arrives?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Keep her head tilted back, pinch her nose shut, put your mouth over hers, and give her two breaths of air. Did you see her chest rise?
CALLER: No, it didn't.
OPERATOR: Readjust her head, and then give her two more breaths.
CALLER: Okay, it rose this time.
OPERATOR: Good. Is she breathing on her own now?
CALLER: No, she's not.
OPERATOR: Okay, put one hand in the middle of her chest, right between her nipples, and push down firmly about two inches.
CALLER: She's gasping for air now.
OPERATOR: If she's gasping, let's start compressions. Can you get her onto the floor, or will you need to do this on the bed?
CALLER: I can't get her onto the floor. I'll do it on the bed.
OPERATOR: All right, do the best you can. With the heel of your hand, press down in the middle of her chest. We're going to pump hard and fast, at least twice per second. Do this until help arrives.
CALLER: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight...
OPERATOR: If she's breathing, you need to stop and check her pulse.
CALLER: I can barely feel a pulse. She's gasping for air every few seconds.
OPERATOR: I hear the ambulance. Go open the door if you can.
CALLER: Okay, I hear them but don't see them yet.
CALLER: They are here now. Thank you so much.
OPERATOR: You're welcome. Are they with you?
CALLER: Yes, they are.
OPERATOR: Okay, take care. Goodbye.
CALLER: Goodbye.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: Yeah, we deliver papers out on Lakeshore, and we lost contact with two carriers. They were out near M89 and Lakeshore.
OPERATOR: Okay, so you lost contact with the carriers, and they were last near M89 and Lakeshore?
CALLER: Yes, we followed their newspapers to the spot where the road is gone, and the water is just rushing up under it. It's bad.
OPERATOR: Do you think they might have driven over it and fallen in?
CALLER: We're almost 100% positive. We followed the newspapers up to that point, and there's no trace beyond that.
OPERATOR: What's your last name, sir?
CALLER: H-U-S-U-S.
OPERATOR: Your first name?
CALLER: Larry.
OPERATOR: Larry, what's the phone number you're calling from?
CALLER: You can call me at 269...
OPERATOR: Okay.
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Do you think that they might have driven into the water?
CALLER: Yes, we think they drove over that washed out road and fell into the water which runs right into Lake Michigan.
OPERATOR: Okay, Larry. You have no way of making contact with them at all?
CALLER: No, there's no way to make contact. The road dead ends, and we can't reach them.
OPERATOR: What kind of car are they in?
CALLER: A green Saturn.
OPERATOR: Where are you right now, Larry?
CALLER: We're at the 34 Shell.
OPERATOR: Okay, one second. I'm just going to try and get somebody down there.
OPERATOR: Do you see where the car went in?
CALLER: No, but it's clear the water runs out to the river into Lake Michigan, and the road is gone.
OPERATOR: Okay, stay on the line, Larry. We need to get the proper information for our officers.
OPERATOR: When was the last time you had contact with them?
CALLER: It's been a couple of hours. Another carrier got stuck in the water, and when we went to help, we realized we hadn't heard from them.
OPERATOR: You mentioned their names earlier. Can you confirm them again?
CALLER: Carissa Green and Dean Taylor.
OPERATOR: What kind of car are you in, Larry?
CALLER: I'm in a silver Ford F-150.
OPERATOR: Okay, hang on a second, Larry. I'm going to get someone over to you.
CALLER: You know, we really think this is an extreme emergency.
OPERATOR: I understand, sir. Please remain at the 34 Shell.
CALLER: We have flashlights and we're considering going back down there.
OPERATOR: I don't recommend going back down there if the area is flooded. It's too dangerous.
CALLER: There is no water on the road, it's just washed out. But it's pitch black and we can't see anything.
OPERATOR: Okay, but I still don't advise it. Stay where you are, and we'll get someone to you.
CALLER: How long will it take?
OPERATOR: I can't give you an exact ETA, but we'll try to get someone there as soon as we can.
CALLER: All right, but we're thinking they drove up to a tree and the road collapsed under them.
OPERATOR: So you think the road washed out from under them and they stopped at a tree and then fell in?
CALLER: Yes, there's a tree right on the other side, and we think they drove up to it and the road gave out from under them.
OPERATOR: Okay. Please stay at the 34 Shell. We'll get someone there as soon as possible.
CALLER: Okay. We're going down to 2817 Lakeshore.
OPERATOR: Please wait at the 34 Shell, Larry. We're doing our best to get someone to you.
CALLER: We're heading to 2817 Lakeshore.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: Hi, this is the Angus Police. I have a bear mauling. I'm out on the trail.
OPERATOR: You have a young girl who was mauled by a bear and is in bad shape?
CALLER: Yes, we need paramedics. I just reported it to somebody else who's going to be calling 911.
OPERATOR: Okay, I'm going to transfer you through to the medics, or did you already talk to them?
CALLER: I have not talked to anybody yet.
OPERATOR: Okay, where are you located?
CALLER: To access us, the easiest way is to go to the Hilltop Ski Area and go down the gas line trail to where it meets Campbell Creek.
OPERATOR: So you're closest to Hilltop Ski Area?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Okay, hold on one second. Now that I've got your location, I need to transfer you through to the medics.
CALLER: Thank you.
OPERATOR: Can you still hear me?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Fire paramedics, what's the location of the emergency?
CALLER: It is on Rovers Run Trail, and the best way to access that is by the gas line trail.
OPERATOR: Okay, what's the problem? Tell me exactly what happened.
CALLER: I just came across a young girl who was mauled by a bear.
OPERATOR: All right. I'm going to ask you some questions about her while my partner gets help started. How old is she?
CALLER: I believe she's about 15 or 16 years old.
OPERATOR: Is she conscious? Is she breathing?
CALLER: She is breathing heavily, yes.
OPERATOR: When did this happen?
CALLER: Within the last probably 15 to 20 minutes.
OPERATOR: Is there any serious bleeding?
CALLER: Yes, severe bleeding.
OPERATOR: Are you with her right now?
CALLER: I am, we're in close proximity to where it happened.
OPERATOR: What kind of injuries does she have?
CALLER: It's hard to tell, it's dark, and I dropped my bike down the trail. I don't have a light.
OPERATOR: Is the animal still nearby?
CALLER: Not that I know of. I hope it's gone away.
OPERATOR: How far are you from Campbell Airstrip Road?
CALLER: If you came up Campbell-Airstrip Road, you would access us by the South Bivouac Trailhead.
OPERATOR: Sir, listen, we understand. How far in are you, about a quarter mile?
CALLER: Yes, we're going to come in off the South Bivouac Trailhead.
OPERATOR: Okay. Our first caller gave us that information and is waiting there for us.
CALLER: Okay, go in the trailhead, and about 100 yards down the trail, there's a right-hand turn.
OPERATOR: Okay, I got it. Now that I've kind of got where you are, hold on while we get the paramedics there.
CALLER: Okay, thank you.
OPERATOR: Does she have any serious bleeding?
CALLER: Yes, I would say so.
OPERATOR: What I want you to do is get a clean, dry cloth or towel, place it on the wound, and press it down firmly without lifting it up to look.
CALLER: I don't know exactly where the wound is, that's the problem.
OPERATOR: Can you ask her where she thinks she's hurt?
CALLER: Do you know where you're hurt?
OPERATOR: Sir, listen, I have a quick question. How close are you to the Campbell Airstrip?
CALLER: We are farther than the actual airstrip. They need to go farther up the road.
OPERATOR: How far up the road from the Campbell Airstrip?
CALLER: I would say a mile and a half, two miles. There will be two obvious trailheads with big wooden signs.
OPERATOR: So they're marked north and south?
CALLER: Yes, they want to go into South Bivouac Trailhead.
OPERATOR: Once they get to the South Bivouac parking lot, they're going to go down the trail and look to the right for a steep dirt trail?
CALLER: Yes, it leads to a footbridge that crosses the creek, then take a right onto the trail. They should have bear protection.
OPERATOR: We're getting the cops to come out there with us.
CALLER: Okay, you're doing great. Just hang in there.
OPERATOR: Is the bear still there?
CALLER: Not that I know of, but it's dark.
OPERATOR: Do you know what kind of bear it was?
CALLER: I don't know.
OPERATOR: Just stay awake and stay alert. Is she breathing regularly?
CALLER: Yes, heavy breathing. She's very conscious.
OPERATOR: Can you hear anybody out there?
CALLER: No, but there's a bike race going on, so someone might pass by soon. I'll have them flag the paramedics.
OPERATOR: Okay, that's good. Let me know if anything changes.
CALLER: Hey, can you stop, please? We have a bear attack. The paramedics are coming to South Bivouac Trailhead.
OPERATOR: You're doing awesome. Just keep calm.
CALLER: Okay, a biker is going up to direct them down to us.
OPERATOR: Great. How is she doing?
CALLER: She seems to be doing okay, still conscious and able to move a bit.
OPERATOR: Okay, just keep her still, we don't want her moving around.
CALLER: I had to move her a bit from the attack spot but will keep her still now.
OPERATOR: You're doing great. Do you know how far up Campbell Airstrip Road the trailhead is?
CALLER: About a mile and a half to two miles. If they start going uphill, they've gone past it.
OPERATOR: We've got officers escorting the medics in right now.
CALLER: Good, that should help. We've got another biker arriving.
OPERATOR: Is that another biker?
CALLER: Yes, they are here to help with flagging down the paramedics.
OPERATOR: Great. Just keep her as still as possible.
CALLER: We have an EMT here now who's assessing her injuries.
OPERATOR: That's good. What injuries can you identify now?
CALLER: A puncture wound to the face and some trauma to the inner thigh.
OPERATOR: Can you keep a clean, dry cloth on the wound with pressure?
CALLER: The EMT is handling it. The wounds don't seem to be bleeding too badly.
OPERATOR: Okay, good. Just keep her calm and still.
CALLER: She's doing okay, breathing more steadily now.
OPERATOR: Let me know if anything changes with her condition.
CALLER: Will do. There seems to be another wound on her back, above her left buttock.
OPERATOR: Okay, just make sure she stays still.
CALLER: She's doing great. The medics should be here soon.
OPERATOR: You're doing a great job. Can you see if the bear did any other damage?
CALLER: It's hard to tell, but it looks like a puncture wound to her throat area.
OPERATOR: We need to assure her that help is on the way.
CALLER: She knows, she's just trying to stay calm. The medics should be here anytime now.
OPERATOR: Okay, let me know when they arrive.
CALLER: Will do.
OPERATOR: Are you still there?
CALLER: Yes, the medics have arrived with the police.
OPERATOR: Okay, I'm going to let you go so you can talk to them. Thank you for helping her.
CALLER: Thank you, goodbye.

CALLER: That's not going to happen. Maybe you didn't hear me. Back them up or I start opening fire.
OPERATOR: Sir, why are you running?
CALLER: You're risking this woman's life. We're heading south. You've got three officers ganging up on me right now, and I have enough ammunition to kill her and myself.
CALLER: Get out of my ass now! They are more than welcome to follow me at a distance. If they continue to do this, people are going to get hurt.
OPERATOR: If the officer following me does not break off pursuit, then people will be hurt.
OPERATOR: Where are you located?
CALLER: I don't even know what officer's following you.
OPERATOR: Can you let me know where you are so I can let the officer know?
CALLER: We're going south on I-95. If they continue to follow me, I will fire a warning shot. The third shot will not be a warning.
OPERATOR: Do you have a weapon on you?
CALLER: You guys don't seem to want to believe me.
OPERATOR: I'm just asking you a question. What kind of gun do you have?
CALLER: I am going to take this young lady back to her home. You will not interfere. Is that understood?
OPERATOR: So you're going where?
CALLER: They are welcome to follow me at a distance, but I'm not telling you where. You understand?
OPERATOR: I don't really understand the situation that's going on.
CALLER: You don't need to. Either the police stay off of my ass and they stay well back, or I'm going to hurt people.
OPERATOR: Okay, good deal.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: I'm at Cracker Barrel. I just informed my husband that I'm leaving him, and we got into an argument. We drove separately, but he refuses to leave the parking lot and keeps circling, waiting for me to leave.
OPERATOR: What kind of vehicle is he driving?
CALLER: He's in a Jeep Liberty. He owns a shotgun, but I didn't see it on him. I did see shotgun shells in his car.
OPERATOR: Can you stay inside the restaurant and wait for the police to arrive?
CALLER: Okay, I'll wait inside.
OPERATOR: Officers are on their way to Cracker Barrel.
OPERATOR: I'm pulling up now, I see the Jeep Liberty driving through the parking lot.

OPERATOR: People are coming out saying he's inside shooting.
CALLER: I'm inside the restaurant. He's got a long gun, it sounds like.
OPERATOR: Radio, notify other units.
CALLER: He's in the girls' bathroom with a gun, according to a witness.
OPERATOR: Alright, we need two units at the back and two at the front.

CALLER: Get the fire department here. Shots fired, and the suspect is down. The gun is out of his hand.
OPERATOR: Confirm, the suspect is down and we have the weapon.
OPERATOR: Rescue units, you can approach; the suspect is in custody.
CALLER: I'm hiding under the counter with another female. We have a dead female at the front desk and a juvenile shot, possibly dead.
OPERATOR: Understood. Stay where you are, help is on the way.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: I always get the two or five rights, so I said I'm going to get extra meat this time.
CALLER: But he didn't even, can you get me extra scrim or can you get my money back?
CALLER: And he saw a hollied.
CALLER: So I just said, I'm going to call the police.

CALLER: And how long?
CALLER: I was trying to get a police officer up here.

OPERATOR: What is the address, ma'am?
CALLER: 1100 McCray Street.
OPERATOR: 1100 McCray, and it's a person out there?
CALLER: Yes, my custodian found a young man. His body is stiff.
OPERATOR: And are you sure he's deceased?
CALLER: Yes, he kicked him, and he's stiff. He didn't move. He appears to be in rigor. There's blood coming out of his nose. I mean, I'm not going to touch him, but I'd say he's definitely dead.
OPERATOR: That's okay. How old does he appear to be?
CALLER: He looks like he's probably between 18 to 22. We're right down from the Wilmington Police Department, but we don't have a school resource officer.
OPERATOR: And you're at 1100 McCray?
CALLER: Yes, ma'am, and I'm the principal here.
OPERATOR: Okay, just stay on the phone for one minute, okay?
CALLER: Yes, ma'am, not a problem.
OPERATOR: Let me go ahead and get some help started over there.
CALLER: Okay. We're going to need the medical examiner or whatever, I guess.
OPERATOR: Is he a black or white male? Can you tell?
CALLER: He's an African American male. We're covering the body so that if we have kids come.
OPERATOR: Hang on a second. Let's make sure you're allowed to touch him. And he has blood coming from where?
CALLER: He's coming out of his right nostril, that kind of ran down his nose.
OPERATOR: Okay, yeah, don't touch him.
CALLER: So can we step in? I don't know how we're going to...
OPERATOR: And you say he's stiff?
CALLER: Yes, ma'am. He's definitely stiff.
CALLER: We're trying to figure out how to keep kids from coming on campus until we can at least get this scene secured so they're not looking at this.
OPERATOR: Okay, and I can tell you how to do CPR, do you think it's...
CALLER: No, ma'am, he's definitely beyond CPR, and we have several of us standing here trained first responders, but he is not.
OPERATOR: Okay. Holy cow. Did anybody see what happened?
CALLER: No, ma'am, we just... I came in the dark this morning. I was here at 5:15, 5:20, and I didn't see anything.
CALLER: My head custodian came at about six or so, and my assistant principal just drove in, and she said there's somebody sleeping out in front of the school.
CALLER: We have to wait until they come to the scene. It looks like something came out of the nose.
CALLER: We may need help stopping buses and parent traffic; I don't think we should let kids or anybody on here until we have this cordoned off.
OPERATOR: You have an SRO on site?
CALLER: Not at the moment. Maybe we can get to lock cars, but we've got to get the paramedics in here first.
OPERATOR: Okay, I'll notify the SROs and maybe they can get over there to help you out.
CALLER: That would be great. Deputy McMillan is at Virgo and Deputy Curry is ours, and I know Sergeant Sears is here quite frequently.
OPERATOR: And you're at Snipes Academy, right?

OPERATOR: Are they black, white, or Hispanic?
CALLER: They're both white males. I think they know I'm here because I have a car out front. So they know I'm inside. I have private security that I'm working with, but they're not with me currently, and they say call 911.

CALLER: He's trying to fix something, but it's really hot up there. He went up about 50 feet. It's just me and my mother here, and we can't get him to come down. Can you please send someone to help?
OPERATOR: Okay, but this does not sound like a life-threatening emergency. If he wants to be in the attic, the police can't make him come down. Is he capable of getting down himself?
CALLER: It's hot up there, and I'm worried if he gets stuck, it could become dangerous. I'm just trying to prevent that.
OPERATOR: Does he have any mental conditions that would prevent him from making a sound decision?

CALLER: You mean my brother-in-law.

One is your brother-in-law who has been missing from work, and the other one is your nephew, Matthew, who has drug issues. And the person who is on the phone with you right now is your brother-in-law's girlfriend?

CALLER: She's on speakerphone. I don't know if you can hear it.
OPERATOR: No, I can't hear it, ma'am. Can you relay the information?
CALLER: Nancy, can you say how you found George, please? Did you hear that, ma'am?

CALLER: I'm calling you from my cell, which is [Number].

CALLER: Something is going on. There's a man screaming for about 30 minutes on the front porch. He goes in and screams that he's God. I mean, it's like delusional stuff.
OPERATOR: Do you know the house number?
CALLER: No, I don't.
CALLER: He stood on the porch and started a monologue. This is not typical at all. This is not a kid; this is a grown man.
OPERATOR: Do you think he might be under the influence of alcohol or drugs?
CALLER: I don't think so. I don't know, I could be wrong. It's just scary because he comes out and screams. At one point, I thought he was talking to someone, but he dropped his pants out there, screaming that he's God, and then slams the door.
OPERATOR: How long has this been going on?
CALLER: This has been going on for about half an hour. He goes back out on the porch, and it's a little scary.

OPERATOR: How old is he?
CALLER: I don't know. Late 30s or 40s, maybe.

CALLER: He's white.
OPERATOR: What's he wearing?
CALLER: Last time I saw him, he was in a t-shirt and nothing else.
OPERATOR: So he was only wearing a t-shirt?
CALLER: Well, he had something. I haven't actually walked out there. I'm afraid to walk out there. He was in a t-shirt and then he pulled down his pants while screaming, 'I am God.' It's like he's flipped out.
OPERATOR: Do you want the police to come by and speak with you after they investigate?
CALLER: I don't see a reason for that.
OPERATOR: Okay, that's fine. The police will be out there as quickly as possible.
CALLER: I have heard this guy say in the past that he has a gun. Not in a threatening way, but he has mentioned it.
OPERATOR: Okay.
CALLER: We had a neighborhood disturbance once, and he made an offhand comment about having a gun. I'm a bit worried now.
OPERATOR: How long ago did he mention the gun?
CALLER: A few months ago. It was just an offhand comment.
OPERATOR: I understand. The police will be out there as quickly as possible. Stay safe inside your home.
CALLER: Alright, I will. Thank you.

CALLER: She was 50, almost 51.
OPERATOR: Is she breathing at all?
CALLER: No, she's not. I put a pillow on her face and held it until she stopped.
OPERATOR: Did you have an argument with her tonight?
CALLER: No, it wasn't an argument.
OPERATOR: Okay. Can you tell me more?
CALLER: My wife has been a chronic alcoholic for quite some time. There's a whole medical history that will come out.
OPERATOR: Okay, what prompted you to do it tonight?
CALLER: I've been to my meeting for sobriety. Sherry has been in and out of hospital with chronic alcoholism for a long time.
OPERATOR: I understand.
CALLER: We drank tonight and talked about it. My wife is now dead. I killed her. There is no argument or dispute about that.
OPERATOR: Was it a mutual decision or was it your decision?
CALLER: We talked about it. She said she couldn't promise a cure for alcoholism.
OPERATOR: I see. Please stay on the line.
CALLER: I put a pillow over her face. She didn't feel any pain because she was very drunk, and I held it until she stopped breathing.
OPERATOR: Okay. Is anyone else in the house?
CALLER: Yes, my son-in-law is here trying to give her CPR.
OPERATOR: Okay, police are on their way. Please stay calm.
CALLER: Get the police here as quickly as you can. I am not denying anything.
OPERATOR: They're on their way. Who am I speaking to?
CALLER: Noel Lavery. There's no point in continuing this conversation. What is done is done.
OPERATOR: I appreciate your honesty. We will be there soon.
CALLER: Thank you.
OPERATOR: Is your son-in-law there? What's his name?
CALLER: His name is Kevin. He rushed in to try and give CPR.
OPERATOR: Did he live there?
CALLER: No, he came from work. He's a shift worker. My wife's daughter from my previous marriage called him.
OPERATOR: Alright, Noel. I'm here. Please stay on the line until help arrives.
CALLER: There's nothing more to do.
OPERATOR: I understand, but please stay on the line.
CALLER: Alright. Thank you for your help.
OPERATOR: We're here for you, Noel.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, where's your emergency?
CALLER: Well, I'm on 41 going south. I just crossed Chamberlain, and a man pulled up next to me. There was a child screaming in his car.
OPERATOR: What kind of vehicle is it?
CALLER: It's a blue Camaro, like from the 90s or early 2000s or something.
OPERATOR: Was it a baby or a child?
CALLER: No, it was a child. It's dark, but I turned to look. The driver is a white male, light-colored hair, sort of plump. He's behind me now. I tried to slow down so he could pass me and I could read his license plate.
OPERATOR: Okay, ma'am, don't hang up, okay?
CALLER: I'm not.
OPERATOR: Where are you now?
CALLER: I'm just crossing Jinx Drive. I'm going very slow, like 45 miles an hour on 41.
OPERATOR: And he's behind you?
CALLER: I think so. He hasn't passed me, and he's going slower than I am, which is odd because we're holding up traffic. I think he saw me looking at him. He's going even slower now.
OPERATOR: Are you pulling over?
CALLER: No, something's going on because he's going even slower now. Okay, he's pulling over to the other lane now.
OPERATOR: Can you give me your name and cell phone number?
CALLER: My name is Jane Kowalski, K-O-W-A-L-S-K-I. My cell phone number is 813-205-4100.
CALLER: Oh shit, he's turning left on Toledo Blade. He's turning left right now.
OPERATOR: He's turning left onto Toledo Blade, and you said it's a blue Camaro with a white male driver?
CALLER: Yes, and there's a kid in the back seat banging on the window. The child looked between 5 and 10 years old, definitely not an infant.
OPERATOR: About how old do you think the child is?
CALLER: I'd say less than 10, maybe between 5 to 10 years old.
OPERATOR: Okay, do you want to try to follow him?
CALLER: I don't know if I can catch up. There's a lot of traffic and I can't get over. The child was screaming, like a 'get me out of here' scream.
OPERATOR: Blue or black Camaro with a white male driver, light-colored hair. Got it. Thanks for calling this in.
CALLER: I'm way past them now and I wouldn't be able to catch up. I didn't want to put myself at risk.
OPERATOR: Alright, Jane. And you're driving a Silver Mercedes?
CALLER: Yes, a Silver Mercedes 380.
OPERATOR: Thank you. Are you in a safe place?
CALLER: I just pulled over into the Toys 'R' Us parking lot at the Town Center Mall.
OPERATOR: Okay, please stay there and keep your doors locked.
CALLER: Okay, I'm in my car with the doors locked.
OPERATOR: Thank you, Jane. We'll have someone follow up with you if needed.
CALLER: Alright, thank you. I just wanted to make sure I called it in.
OPERATOR: You did the right thing. Thank you for calling.
CALLER: God, I hope everything turns out okay.
OPERATOR: We have your number. If we need more information, we'll call you back. Thank you.

CALLER: We didn't touch anything. But we noticed it looks like a trail.

CALLER: Okay, she's really upset.
OPERATOR: We're not going down there without the police. Police are on their way.
CALLER: Have you tried calling out for him or anything?
OPERATOR: Yes, we've done that.
OPERATOR: Does he have his wallet or anything? Is that missing, or does he have it with him?

CALLER: No, I can't see it. He's locked up in the room.
OPERATOR: Mommy, go there. Open the door.
CALLER: Okay, ma'am, it looks like I've got an officer that should be there.
OPERATOR: Ma'am, did he put the knife back?
CALLER: Ma'am.
OPERATOR: Is that a gun?
CALLER: Yeah, but he doesn't have a gun.
OPERATOR: Are you with the officer now?
CALLER: He's somebody to talk to him. No, put it back.
OPERATOR: Are you with the officer, ma'am?
CALLER: Oh, excuse me. I was just trying to be...
OPERATOR: Ma'am, is that the officer?
CALLER: Thank you, sir.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: I have a gunshot victim here.
OPERATOR: Okay, tell me exactly what happened.
CALLER: He was breaking into the house. I shot him.
OPERATOR: What's the phone number you're calling from?
CALLER: It's [phone number].
OPERATOR: How old is he?
CALLER: He's 30.
OPERATOR: Are you with him now?
CALLER: He's outside. I believe he's shot in the head.
OPERATOR: Can you just send somebody here, please?
OPERATOR: I need you to tell me what happened, ma'am.
CALLER: He was breaking into the house.
OPERATOR: Do you know who it was?
CALLER: Yes, that's my roommate.
OPERATOR: And how did he get the gunshot wound?
CALLER: From me.
OPERATOR: Where is the gun now?
CALLER: It's here at the house.
OPERATOR: Is he awake?
CALLER: I don't know. I've not been out there. Please, come on.
OPERATOR: Is he breathing?
CALLER: I don't know, please.
OPERATOR: We're going to have somebody sent that way. I just need you to answer my questions as best you can, okay?
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Is there any way you could go out and check on him?
CALLER: Yes, I can. Hold on.
OPERATOR: If you feel comfortable doing so.
CALLER: Yes, he's breathing, but he's struggling.
OPERATOR: Okay, he is breathing?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: And where is the gunshot wound?
CALLER: It's to the head.
OPERATOR: Is there any serious bleeding?
CALLER: Yes, there's bleeding. He's unconscious.
OPERATOR: Is there more than one wound?
CALLER: No, just the one wound.
OPERATOR: When did this happen?
CALLER: Just now.
OPERATOR: Is there any way you could put the gun away or lock it up?
CALLER: Yes, I can do that.
OPERATOR: What kind of gun is it?
CALLER: It's a .22 pistol.
OPERATOR: What's your name?
CALLER: James Lang.
OPERATOR: And what's the roommate's name?
CALLER: Richard Bartlett.
OPERATOR: Was he armed or did he have any weapons?
CALLER: No, no weapons. Just very violent.
OPERATOR: If you could just stay on the line for me, I'm going to give the responders some instructions, okay?
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Are you still there, sir?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Were you able to put the gun away?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Is there any way you could get outside to the patient with the phone?
CALLER: No, I don't have a cordless phone.
OPERATOR: Is there anybody else there with you?
CALLER: No, I'm alone.
OPERATOR: I need you to get to the patient if able. Lay him flat on his back to keep his airway open.
CALLER: Okay, I will do that.
OPERATOR: If able, get a clean, dry cloth or towel and place it firmly on the wound. Don't lift it up to look.
CALLER: Okay, I can do that.
OPERATOR: Is he still breathing?
CALLER: Yes, but he sounds like he's gurgling.
OPERATOR: We need to keep his airway open. Make sure he is flat on his back with no pillows.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Check his mouth for food or vomit.
CALLER: He's not vomiting.
OPERATOR: How long will it be until responders arrive?
OPERATOR: They are on their way as quickly as possible.
OPERATOR: Don't put direct pressure if there is any visible fracture. Just apply firm pressure around the wound.
CALLER: There doesn’t appear to be a large amount of blood.
OPERATOR: Can you ensure his head is tilted back to maintain the airway?
CALLER: I can't do that and come back to the phone.
OPERATOR: Stay with him and monitor his breathing. Is there no way to bring the phone any closer?
CALLER: No.
OPERATOR: Stay with him and ensure he continues breathing. I'm staying on the line.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Are you still there, sir? Hello?
CALLER: Yes, I'm here.
OPERATOR: Is he still breathing?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: The main thing is to monitor that as best you can. They're here. Thank God.
OPERATOR: Stay separated from the weapon.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Let me know when they're right there with you.
CALLER: Do you want me to step to the door?
OPERATOR: Let me know when they're with you. Just make sure to stay separated from the gun.
CALLER: They're on the porch.
OPERATOR: If they're there with you, go ahead and step outside.
CALLER: Should I hold on, or they're asking questions?
OPERATOR: If you could just let me know when they're with you and stay separated from the weapon.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: Okay, and when you say he's down, what do you mean?
OPERATOR: She says he's cold and he's not breathing.
CALLER: She says she's been trying to give him CPR.
OPERATOR: Okay. Is there any way you can get a phone, a cell phone, or something over there to him?
CALLER: Well, I'll tell you what, I'm giving it to her right here. Here she is, right here.
OPERATOR: Okay. Hello, ma'am.
CALLER: Yes, ma'am.
OPERATOR: Okay. Can you get in there with him?
CALLER: I've been there trying to do mouth-to-mouth, but he's cold and stiff, really cold and stiff.
OPERATOR: Okay.
CALLER: And I've been gone all day hunting for him because he's got a lot of mental problems, and he likes to go down to Durham and Raleigh.
CALLER: And he was stopped by the Apex Police about a year ago because it was like 4 in the morning, and he was out there.
OPERATOR: Okay.
CALLER: He was going to go to the gang areas and get killed because he doesn't want to die of his lymphoma.
OPERATOR: Okay. Do you have a cell phone at all?
CALLER: Yeah, but it died. It died.
OPERATOR: What's your name?
CALLER: Jolene Hardy.
OPERATOR: Jolene Harvey?
CALLER: Hardy. H-A-R-D-Y.
OPERATOR: Okay. Alright. I'm just going to ask you some questions. How old is he?
CALLER: He's 60 years old.
OPERATOR: Okay.
CALLER: I'm going to sit down before I fall down.
OPERATOR: Okay. I have them on the way to you. I'm just going to talk to you while they're on the way.
CALLER: I'm at my neighbor's house right now because I tried all that time to resuscitate him and he's so cold and I couldn't stand it anymore.
CALLER: I came over here because it finally dawned on me I wasn't getting anywhere with it and he just got colder.
CALLER: I've been hunting for him all last night and all day. I haven't had any sleep.
CALLER: He's been doing these things for six years since he got sick.
OPERATOR: Okay, last you were over there with him, was he awake?
CALLER: No, he was as cold as a bone.
OPERATOR: Was he breathing?
CALLER: No, he's stiff and cold as a bone. I blew in his mouth and nothing happened. His chest didn't rise or anything because he's already cold.
OPERATOR: Okay. Do you think he's beyond any help?
CALLER: Oh, God, yes.
CALLER: I've never seen a dead person outside of a coffin, and I had to put my mouth on his. It was so cold and his teeth are all knocked out.
OPERATOR: His teeth are knocked out?
CALLER: Yes, because he hangs out sometimes he goes down to Raleigh and Durham and he walks. About a year ago, the Apex Police saw him at 4 in the morning heading toward Raleigh. They stopped and talked to him.
CALLER: He said, is there a law against me walking down the street at 4 in the morning? They said, well, no. He said, well, I'm not a window peeper or nothing. Can't I be on my way? And they said, yes.
OPERATOR: Jolene, when's the last time you saw him?
CALLER: I saw him early yesterday morning. And then he took off somewhere that evening.
OPERATOR: When's the last time you were home?
CALLER: I've been out all night and all day looking for him.
OPERATOR: Okay.
CALLER: I got home about 3:30 this afternoon.
OPERATOR: So before 3:30 this afternoon, when was the last time you were physically home?
CALLER: I was home once early morning, and he wasn't there then. But when I came back now, he is.
OPERATOR: Okay, and you've been doing CPR?
CALLER: Yes, I have.
CALLER: I got a heart condition and high blood pressure and cholesterol, and I got sugar diabetes a little bit. And I couldn't breathe deep enough, but I mean, he was already sitting cold.
CALLER: He had to come home sometime in the morning time, not early morning, but later morning. Because I just went in there about 3:30.
OPERATOR: Okay, is that the ambulance I hear pulling up?
CALLER: Yes, I hear it.
OPERATOR: Okay, go ahead and talk to them.
CALLER: Alright.
OPERATOR: Thank you. Bye-bye.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: Uh, yes, this is Kirby Nicol, the mayor of Capitola. I'm calling for assistance.
OPERATOR: Okay, where is this assistance needed, sir?
CALLER: I'd like to have an officer come to 4850 Emerald Street.
OPERATOR: What's going on there?
CALLER: We've got a person here who is not fit to drive and needs to be taken back home.
OPERATOR: Okay, so I just need to clarify, is the address 4850 Emerald Street?
CALLER: Yes, 4850 Emerald Street.
OPERATOR: Alright. We'll send someone over. No lights and no sirens. And who's the person that needs assistance?

CALLER: The person that is ill is Jim Harris.
OPERATOR: Okay. We will send someone to the address to assess the situation. Thank you.
CALLER: Thank you so much.
OPERATOR: You're welcome. Goodbye.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: I think we're on I-75.
OPERATOR: I-75? Do you know what mile marker?
CALLER: No, I can't see anything. The fog is so dense and we just hit a guardrail. I think there was an accident behind us because I heard it.
OPERATOR: Are you northbound or southbound?
CALLER: We are going southbound on I-75.
OPERATOR: Okay, we're going to get you some help out there. What's the phone number you're calling from?
CALLER: Oh my gosh, it's so dark here.
OPERATOR: Okay, and what is the city that you're nearest? Have you seen any signs for a city recently?
CALLER: Are we near Gainesville? We just passed Gainesville, University.
OPERATOR: Okay, hold on just one second while I get this in, okay?
CALLER: Okay, it's very dangerous, so please be careful.
OPERATOR: Are you out of the roadway?
CALLER: We are out as far as we possibly can.
OPERATOR: That's good. Are there any injuries in your vehicle?
CALLER: No, no, thank God.
CALLER: But I think I heard another crash back there.
OPERATOR: You heard another crash?
CALLER: I thought I did, but I'm not sure.
OPERATOR: What's the color, make, and model of your vehicle?
CALLER: We just hit the guardrail.
OPERATOR: Did you hit the guardrail or was there another vehicle involved?
CALLER: No, we hit the guardrail.
OPERATOR: Okay, and you said you are out of the road as much as you can be? Are you blocking any lanes?
CALLER: No.
CALLER: Oh, someone stopped to help us.
OPERATOR: That's good, but stay inside your vehicle until law enforcement gets there. Do you smell any gas or see any leaks?
CALLER: No, just the smoke from the fog.
OPERATOR: Okay, hold on just one second. We are getting help out there to you. Are you able to talk to my friend?
CALLER: Yes, sure.
OPERATOR: Hello, ma'am. We have help on the way. I'm showing you near Mile Marker 379, could that be right?
CALLER: Yeah, we passed the exit to Gainesville, right?
OPERATOR: Are you southbound?
CALLER: Yes, ma'am.
OPERATOR: Okay, just wanted to double check. What's your name?
CALLER: No injuries, but I think we need a tow truck.
OPERATOR: That's fine. We can sort that out. I'm going to stay on the line with you until units find you. It's very hazy, so I want to make sure they can locate you.
CALLER: It's really bad out here. People are stopping.
OPERATOR: If you're going southbound, are you on the left side or the right side of the road?
CALLER: I pulled the car all the way to the right side onto the grass.
OPERATOR: Okay, you said the right side?
OPERATOR: Hold on just one second. Okay.
CALLER: Oh no, another accident!
OPERATOR: There was another accident?
CALLER: Yes, a truck. I think it was a semi.
OPERATOR: What kind of truck, like a semi or a pickup?
CALLER: We can't see. The haze is too thick.
CALLER: I do hear a police officer or an ambulance.
OPERATOR: Hold on just one second. Stand on the line, don't hang up.
CALLER: No problem.
OPERATOR: Okay, you said another vehicle hit northbound?
CALLER: Yes, it looks like another accident on the other side.
CALLER: This is the third one now.
OPERATOR: All right, if you're able to, turn on your emergency flashers, get out of your vehicle, and move as far away from traffic as possible.
CALLER: Okay, we're out as far as we can be.
OPERATOR: You're doing really well. Are there any obvious injuries in any other vehicles that you can see?
CALLER: No, but it's hard to see anything.
OPERATOR: Okay, just tell everyone to turn on their headlights and flashers and get out of the road.
CALLER: Okay, she said everyone get as far off the road as you can and put on your flashers.
OPERATOR: Is everyone out of their vehicles?
CALLER: Yes, ma'am.
OPERATOR: I'm going to ask you some medical questions. How many people would you guess are injured?
CALLER: Oh no, another accident!
OPERATOR: Okay, that's the fourth vehicle now. Are you with the patients right now?
CALLER: No, we are too far away. We can't see much.
OPERATOR: Do you know if there are chemicals or other hazards involved?
CALLER: Couldn't tell you.
CALLER: Another crash!
OPERATOR: This is bad, people can't see. Is anyone pinned or trapped in their vehicles?
CALLER: We can't tell. This is getting worse. Another one just happened.
OPERATOR: Okay, how many vehicles now?
CALLER: 16 now.
OPERATOR: Okay, do you see any fire or anything like that?
CALLER: No fire. We can hardly see our hazards.
CALLER: Here comes another one. Oh my God, they're coming too fast!
OPERATOR: Just keep yourself out of traffic. Try to direct people out of the road if you can, but keep safe.
OPERATOR: Paramedics and police are on the way. Lots of help is coming.
CALLER: Another accident! This is getting bad.
OPERATOR: Just keep your hazard lights on and stay out of traffic. Help is on the way.
OPERATOR: Don't offer anyone anything to eat or drink, it might make them sick.
OPERATOR: Let anyone injured rest in the most comfortable position. Don't move them unless it's absolutely necessary.
CALLER: We see some people lying on the floor. There's someone with a flashlight now.
OPERATOR: You're doing a great job. Just keep everyone calm and wait for help. Are the semis rolled over?
CALLER: We can't see very well.
CALLER: There's people crying. I think someone might be dying.
OPERATOR: Can you see anything specific or just hear crying?
CALLER: We're seeing some lights now from other vehicles.
OPERATOR: Okay, please hold on and stay on the line.
CALLER: Should I give you another number in case my phone dies?
OPERATOR: Yes, please give me the other number.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: Yes, I'm seeing a plane.
OPERATOR: Good morning. Can you describe what you're seeing?
CALLER: We just saw a big airliner being escorted by two fighter planes.
OPERATOR: Two fighter planes? Can you give me more details?
CALLER: It was flying low over the Medical Center. I thought it might crash into us.
OPERATOR: Hold on a second. Let me check. [Pause] Hello? There's nothing going on, they're just testing.
CALLER: All right. Thank you. I'll let you know if something else happens.
CALLER: For whatever it's worth, I'm a motorist with a cell phone. I was coming through Journal Square just now. A four-engine passenger plane was making a sharp bank, and there was a military fighter plane flying right alongside it.
OPERATOR: A passenger plane and a military plane were flying over Journal Square?
CALLER: Yes, they were high up, and the passenger plane was making a sharp turn. The military plane was right alongside it. It didn't look right, so I thought I'd let someone know.
OPERATOR: Okay, sir. We will notify the relevant authorities. Thank you for letting us know.
CALLER: The F-18 chasing a big commercial plane round and round over downtown Jersey?
OPERATOR: Yes, we're aware of it.
CALLER: Okay, thank you.
CALLER: Well, there's a plane.
OPERATOR: Yes, ma'am. Please don't worry. It's just a test.
CALLER: No, no, it's impossible. There's still fighter planes.
OPERATOR: Ma'am, the planes are just doing tests. There's nothing to worry about.
CALLER: No, that was a fighter and a commercial airplane. It went to Newark, and it came back towards me. I got pictures of it.
OPERATOR: All right, ma'am. There's nothing to worry about. It's just testing, okay?
CALLER: I just had two unusual aircraft fly really close over my building. Is there something going on?
OPERATOR: Yes, they're testing. There's nothing to be alarmed about.

CALLER: Yes, sir.
OPERATOR: I can hear you. Your building is evacuating?
CALLER: Yes, but you say it's a test?
OPERATOR: Yes, it's just a test. There's nothing to worry about.
CALLER: Okay, and it is a test? Who's testing?
OPERATOR: The authorities are conducting test runs. There's nothing to worry about.
CALLER: Hi, do you know why there's an airplane flying low?
OPERATOR: Yes, ma'am. The police are well aware of it. They're doing test runs.
CALLER: Okay, thanks.
CALLER: I'm in number 480 Washington Boulevard building and we're seeing a big jumbo plane circling around this area.
OPERATOR: They're testing. There's nothing to worry about.
CALLER: Hello, my name is Elsa Salazar.
OPERATOR: Ma'am, what is your emergency?
CALLER: The emergency is an airplane.
OPERATOR: Ma'am, it's a test run. The police are aware of it. There's nothing for you to worry about.

CALLER: I'm at a building in Jersey City, 77 Hudson Street, and there's an airliner circling.
OPERATOR: They're doing testing on the planes. There's nothing to worry about.
CALLER: There's a whole crew here in emergency mode.

CALLER: She's on the floor.
OPERATOR: Okay. What's her name?
CALLER: Leanne Miller.
OPERATOR: Have you been drinking tonight?
CALLER: No, I'm not.
OPERATOR: Okay. You don't have any other weapons on you?
CALLER: No.
OPERATOR: What color shirt do you have on?
CALLER: I'm in my underwear.
OPERATOR: Okay, I've got officers on the way. You just need to stay on the phone with me until they get there, okay?
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Is there anybody else in the house?
CALLER: No.
OPERATOR: Do you have a shirt on or just your underwear?
CALLER: I'm just in regular underwear.
CALLER: Are you sure that you did this and you're not dreaming?

CALLER: Because I scared the shit out of them. I was screaming at the top of my lungs. And I killed them.
OPERATOR: Do you have any other family members here in Glendale?
CALLER: Not in Glendale, well, her family.
OPERATOR: Her family lives here?
CALLER: Yeah.
OPERATOR: Have you ever had any thoughts of doing this before?
CALLER: Never, never, ever, ever. It just hit me like a brick in the face. I don't even know why I did it. I don't even have a valid reason.

CALLER: I pray to God, this is a dream. I hope to God this is a dream. But it's not. It's real. God, please.

CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Are you going outside?
CALLER: Yeah.
OPERATOR: You're out the front door?
CALLER: Yes.

OPERATOR: Good, just stay clear of any potential danger. Emergency units are on their way to your location.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: I robbed somebody downtown Portland at 9th Point. And I just wanted to let you guys know that I did that. I'm not going to commit suicide. I'm standing on a 10-story high building.
OPERATOR: Okay, where are you?
CALLER: I don't want to release that information. I just wanted to let you guys know that it was me.
OPERATOR: You're not going to tell me where you are. Why are you calling me?
CALLER: Because I'd like to let you guys know that I committed a robbery, and I plan to end my life soon.
OPERATOR: What's your name?
CALLER: Brad Morgan.
OPERATOR: Is there anyone we should call and let know?
CALLER: I'd like you to contact Karina Bartley, but it's up to you guys.
OPERATOR: Do you have a phone number for this person?
CALLER: She won't answer the phone, but I've been trying to contact her.
OPERATOR: Who is this person to you?
CALLER: She's my ex-girlfriend.
OPERATOR: How long ago did she become your ex-girlfriend?
CALLER: About three weeks ago.
OPERATOR: And you're going to jump off the building because of that or some other reason?
CALLER: I've gotten myself into a lot of trouble lately. My girlfriend took my son from me and denied my visiting time. I tried to go through the courts to work things out, but my life is just in a bad place, so I feel that I no longer need to live.
OPERATOR: And that's your final decision? There's no way I can talk you out of that?
CALLER: No. I just wanted to give you guys a heads up about what's going on.
OPERATOR: Okay, tell me her name again. I didn't catch it.
CALLER: Karina Bartley.
OPERATOR: What's your phone number?
CALLER: Hold on one second. It's 503-839-3689.
OPERATOR: This is the ex-girlfriend who's the mother of your child?
CALLER: Yeah.
OPERATOR: How old is your child?
CALLER: He's eight months old.
OPERATOR: It's too bad that you're not going to get to see him and talk to him when he's older, don't you think?
CALLER: I'd be in jail if I went back to see him anyway.
OPERATOR: Don't you think you'd still prefer to be alive so he has a dad?
CALLER: He probably would, but I'm not thinking about that right now.
OPERATOR: How did you get up to the building? Did you walk or drive?
CALLER: I don't have a vehicle, so I walked.
OPERATOR: Okay. Are you on top of a business or a parking structure?
CALLER: It's a parking structure. I can see Pioneer Square from here.
OPERATOR: Can you talk to me a little bit longer before you do anything you can't take back?
CALLER: I know I can’t take it back once I do it, and I'm really debating on whether to do it or not.
OPERATOR: I'm going to give you a really great deal. Are you ready for it?
CALLER: What?
OPERATOR: This is a one-time-only deal, and only from me. I will believe everything you tell me on this phone call. Everything. You have my word.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: So, talk to someone who is prepared to believe you. Tell me your side.
CALLER: The reason why my girlfriend broke up with me is because we got into a little argument. She told the police officer that I hung up the phone while she was trying to make a police report, and that's why I got arrested. I sat in jail for four days and got a restraining order while I was in there.
OPERATOR: Was that a long time ago?
CALLER: No, just recently.
OPERATOR: And the cops didn't believe you because of your record?
CALLER: Yes. That's why I went to jail.
OPERATOR: You tell me what really happened.
CALLER: I was trying to leave with my son. She took my son from me, so I took him back and pushed her left arm at the door because she was trying to hold me in our apartment. Not like shoved her, but I put my hand on the door knob and elbowed her away a little. Then I started proceeding down to the max to get on the Max to go see my parents. She flagged down the sheriff who was driving by. She gave him her side of the story, and I gave him mine. He arrested me because I hung up the police call.
OPERATOR: I understand that was a bad thing at the time, but it got me arrested and made it so I couldn't see my son either longer than I was supposed to.
CALLER: After that, my girlfriend says I can call and talk to my son. When I call, she calls the police and says I'm contacting her, and now they want to arrest me for that.
OPERATOR: Was there a no-contact order?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: And then she called the police when you did?
CALLER: Yes.
CALLER: I just feel like I no longer need to live. She's just putting me down every which way. I have nobody besides her.
OPERATOR: Hang on a second. Did the initial call and the no-contact order come from the judge after the hang-up incident?
CALLER: It came from the judge, yes.
OPERATOR: That's a temporary thing for now. That’s not an irrevocable decision. You have to work through the system and wait it out.
CALLER: The problem is that I've been in the system my whole life, and I'm tired of it. It’s like I've been constantly trying to get out from under a dark cloud.
OPERATOR: Doing bad things doesn't define you forever. You learn from mistakes and become a better person because of it. Ending your life is cheating. You get to grow beyond your past.
CALLER: I appreciate the sweet talk. I really do. It feels good to talk to someone.
OPERATOR: I'm not just trying to make you feel better. Everyone deals with consequences, but you get to choose to become better. You’re not stuck where you are.
CALLER: When I try to be better, things just fall apart and crash back down on me.
OPERATOR: Have you tried to get help? You said you've been working with the system for a long time.
CALLER: I have a criminal background. I've been with the wrong crowd, done the wrong things.
OPERATOR: Admitting to making bad choices is excellent, but you don’t have to stay there. You get to choose to be different.
CALLER: That's what I'm doing right now. I'm choosing to end it.
OPERATOR: Everyone dies. That doesn't make you different. You want to be a better man, not just a dead man. Your son needs you to be the better man.
CALLER: The reason why I'm really mad is she's posting on Facebook, making it visible to me, showing she's with another guy. I feel like she orchestrated this. Plus, I took care of my son the first eight months, and now she's claiming him on her taxes.
OPERATOR: It sounds like you're not getting a fair deal, but removing yourself from the situation doesn't hurt her. You’re punishing yourself for what she did. Don't do that.
CALLER: I was a part of this. I made mistakes too. She even got my cousin against me. The cops are always on her side.
OPERATOR: It seems like you have tried to work things out, but have you sought out help from professionals?
CALLER: I've been fighting the courts and police my whole life. I'm tired of it. I feel like shooting one of them right now.
OPERATOR: Please don't do that.
OPERATOR: The police in the area want to help you. They don’t want to see you dead on the pavement. Can you tell me what you're wearing so they can find you?
CALLER: I'm wearing a red backpack and a black hoodie with red on it.
OPERATOR: Do you have any weapons on you?
CALLER: Possibly.
OPERATOR: I'm just going to let them know what you’ve said. They want to help you, not hurt you.
CALLER: I'd actually prefer for a police officer to shoot me. But I don't want to go back to that jailhouse again and be treated like a rag doll.
OPERATOR: They don't want to shoot you, Brad. That’s not what they want to do.
CALLER: I feel like they do. I've been beaten by nightsticks and maced. They’ve bruised me.
OPERATOR: They do not want to kill you. They want to ensure your safety, just like I do.
CALLER: Police are circling the building. They don't know how to get in. I walked up the stairs from the Max. It's easy to clean up.
OPERATOR: Please, don't do anything rash. I know you're feeling trapped, but hurting yourself isn't the answer.
CALLER: I'm a good person. My girlfriend keeps hurting me.
OPERATOR: You said she's posting on Facebook. How do you know?
CALLER: I have friends on her Facebook. They show me.
OPERATOR: I understand that must hurt, but there are ways to work through this.
CALLER: She even wrote on Facebook, 'I'm done with you. Leave me alone.' I thought we were in this together.
OPERATOR: That's really tough. Is she older than you?
CALLER: No, she's younger.
OPERATOR: She's playing with your emotions, but hurting yourself isn't the way to stop her.
CALLER: The police have found me.
OPERATOR: Would you do me a huge favor? Please don't do anything rash. Put your hands up and go talk to them. Let them help you.
CALLER: Alright, I'm cool with that.
OPERATOR: Please, just go to them and let them help you.
CALLER: I'm not going to the police. I'm not going back to that jailhouse.
OPERATOR: You're not doing anything wrong tonight. Your safety is the priority.
CALLER: Cops won't be able to reach me. I got to a place they cannot.
OPERATOR: They want to help you. Nobody wants to see you hurt.
CALLER: I've never seen it before, but I imagine it’s quick and painless.
OPERATOR: It's not. I promise you. It’s painful for everyone involved.
CALLER: The police are talking to me. I’ll let you go.
OPERATOR: Please remember, there are people who care about you. Let them help.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: My wife is dying and the nurses don't want to help her out.
OPERATOR: Okay, what do you mean she's dying? What's wrong with her?
CALLER: She's vomiting blood.
OPERATOR: Okay, and why aren't they helping her?
CALLER: No, ma'am, they're just watching her. They're not doing anything.
OPERATOR: Sir, you need to contact a nurse or a doctor and let them know she's vomiting blood. Paramedics are not going to pick up someone from a hospital.
CALLER: They don't let me. They won't let me in.
OPERATOR: If she's in the emergency room, you need to speak with the hospital staff or security. Paramedics cannot intervene inside a hospital.
CALLER: Okay, thank you.
OPERATOR: You're welcome.
OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: This lady is in the emergency room at Martin Luther King, and they are overlooking her. They keep discharging her, and she's definitely sick.
OPERATOR: Ma'am, you're already at a hospital. If you're not satisfied with the care, you need to speak with the hospital supervisors.
CALLER: But it's an emergency. They're not helping her.
OPERATOR: I understand your concern, but 911 is for life-threatening emergencies. You need to address this with the hospital administration.
CALLER: You're not helping me!
OPERATOR: Ma'am, I cannot do anything about the quality of care at the hospital. Please contact the hospital supervisors.
CALLER: May God strike you for acting the way you do.
OPERATOR: I'm sorry you feel that way, but this line is for emergency purposes only.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: Yes, is this a police station?
OPERATOR: Yes, it is. How can we help you?
CALLER: Yeah, okay, I know this sounds ridiculous, but I'm on 24th Street at a car wash, and I'm stuck inside. I put $5 in, it sprayed a soak on me, and now the doors won't open, and I'm scared to get out of the car.
OPERATOR: What's the name of the car wash?
CALLER: It's, um, I don't know. It's on 24th Street. It's next to a party store, I think. I'm really freaked out.
OPERATOR: You're on 24th Street? Do you know any other landmarks around there?
CALLER: Yeah, I'm across from Mueller Brass.
OPERATOR: Okay, you're across from Mueller Brass. Hold on just a minute, okay? Please don't hang up.
CALLER: Alright, thanks.
OPERATOR: Hello?
CALLER: Yeah.
OPERATOR: Okay, can you explain again? You can't move your car out?
CALLER: Yeah, the garage doors are shut on both sides and they're not opening.
OPERATOR: Was there anybody working there, or is it one of those self-serve washes?
CALLER: It's a self-serve. It sprayed a soak on my car, and now nothing else is happening. Both doors are shut.
OPERATOR: And you don't know the name of the place at all?
CALLER: It's something like Super something, I can't remember. I'm across from Mueller Brass and on 24th Street.
OPERATOR: And you're in a Jeep, you said? Is it that you can't even see outside?
CALLER: Yes, I'm in a Jeep, and I'm really freaking out.
OPERATOR: Alright. Your call says you're calling from Flint?
CALLER: No, that's just my cell phone.
OPERATOR: Do you have enough battery on your phone?
CALLER: I have a Boost phone, and I'm about to run out of minutes.
OPERATOR: Alright. I'm going to try to help you here. Is everything running inside the car wash, like the equipment?
CALLER: No, nothing's running.
OPERATOR: Can you get out of your car and see if there's a button on the wall that you can push to open the doors? There should be something you can press.
CALLER: There's a guy behind me. I hope he doesn't start it.
OPERATOR: If he starts it, you might be able to get out. But try to see if there's a button inside that can open the doors first.
CALLER: But if he starts the wash, I'm going to get super soaked.
OPERATOR: He should know it's cold, and it won't start immediately. Check for a button on the wall.
CALLER: Okay. There are seven buttons, but none of them are labeled to open the door.
OPERATOR: Alright, we'll try to find you. What's the exact name of the car wash, if you can see it?
CALLER: It's called Best Auto Wash. B-E-S-T Auto Wash.
OPERATOR: Alright. Tell the people outside to call the number on the building so the manager can come and get you out.
CALLER: I called the number already, and it went to an answering machine.
OPERATOR: Leave a message, tell them to get down there. Make sure they understand it's urgent.
CALLER: I left two messages already. But my minutes are running out.
OPERATOR: What's the phone number you called?
CALLER: I called 929-8889. It was an emergency number.
OPERATOR: Alright. We'll try contacting them for you, but there should be a button on the wall to open the doors.
CALLER: I can't see anything helpful. I'm stuck here.
OPERATOR: Okay, get out of your car and try checking the buttons again on the wall. There should be something up there.
CALLER: I got out of the car now. I already left a message on the machine.
OPERATOR: Alright. We will try contacting the owner of the car wash for you, but officers can't come over to break the door to let you out.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Good luck. Stay safe.
CALLER: Alright, bye.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: I need to report a murder.
OPERATOR: Okay, where is that, sir?
CALLER: 167 Redstone Drive in Warrington.
OPERATOR: 167?
CALLER: Yes, 167.
OPERATOR: Okay, can you tell me about what's going on there?
CALLER: Mother and son, beaten to death.
OPERATOR: And you just found them?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Who are you?
CALLER: I am the husband.
OPERATOR: Did you do it?
CALLER: Yes, I did.
OPERATOR: What's your name, sir?
CALLER: Chris.
OPERATOR: Last name?
CALLER: Moyer.
OPERATOR: M-O-Y-E-R?
CALLER: Correct.
OPERATOR: What's your phone number, Chris?
CALLER: It is 267-927-0245.
OPERATOR: You're there now?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Okay, 167 Redstone Drive?
CALLER: Correct.
OPERATOR: Okay, are you sure they're dead?
CALLER: I am positive.
OPERATOR: Are you still armed?
CALLER: No.
OPERATOR: Okay, I'm sending someone right now, Chris.
CALLER: Thank you.
OPERATOR: You're welcome.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: Oh my God. I'm on 3rd Avenue by the railroad tracks. Somebody just tried to jump on the train and severed her legs.
OPERATOR: Okay. Third Avenue. Can you confirm the cross street?
CALLER: We're on the west side of the railroad tracks on 3rd Avenue, at Atwood.
OPERATOR: Do not move her! An ambulance is on the way. Where's the victim located?
CALLER: The victim is on the west side. We are at 3rd and Atwood. There were four individuals, one succeeded in jumping, and the other fell.
OPERATOR: Okay. I'm going to ask you some questions. Do you have a cell phone?
CALLER: I have my cell phone, but if I go over there, it's going to be too loud.
OPERATOR: That's okay. If you are an EMT, you can probably do more help than anyone else. Let me know when you're with her.
CALLER: They're on the way. We're not going to put a tourniquet on her. They're like, trying to pick her up.
OPERATOR: No, we don't want to move her. Just hold pressure as much as you can.
CALLER: There's another nurse on scene holding femoral pressure. She's in her early 20s.
OPERATOR: Okay. Is she awake and breathing?
CALLER: She's 17 years old. She is awake and breathing. Her name is Anna.
OPERATOR: Is she completely alert?
CALLER: She's alert and talking. Now she's crying.
OPERATOR: Okay. Where is the leg injury located? At the ankle or knee?
CALLER: One is mid-thigh on the left side. The right leg looks like it's right below the knee.
OPERATOR: Is the amputated part still there?
CALLER: The left leg may not be, but the right leg definitely is.
OPERATOR: I've got units on the way. If you can, without traumatizing her, collect those amputated parts if it's safe.
CALLER: The train's still moving. It's a really long train.
OPERATOR: Okay, then don't try to collect them. Do you have something to press against the amputations to control the bleeding?
CALLER: Yes, we have femoral pressure on the left and a T-shirt around the right.
OPERATOR: Good. Just add more if it soaks through and continue with femoral pressure.
CALLER: We are keeping femoral pressure. Two firefighters are here now.
OPERATOR: Okay. I'll let you go so you can talk to them.
CALLER: Okay, thank you.
OPERATOR: You're welcome. Bye.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: Oh my God! Oh my God!
OPERATOR: This is 9-1-1. I need you to stop screaming so I can hear you.
CALLER: Oh my God! My boyfriend, he’s been hurt! He needs an ambulance!
OPERATOR: What's wrong with him? What happened?
CALLER: Oh my God, he was shot in the head with a gun!
OPERATOR: Ma'am, I need you to calm down so I can understand you and send help. Take a deep breath. What's going on?
CALLER: Hurry! Hurry! He’s not breathing!
OPERATOR: Listen to me, I'm going to transfer you to the paramedics. They're going to give you CPR instructions. Do not hang up, okay?
CALLER: Okay, I understand. Please hurry!
CALLER: Baby, baby! Oh my God, no!
OPERATOR: This is the fire department. What's the address of the emergency?
CALLER: Come quick! He needs help!
OPERATOR: I need your phone number.
CALLER: It's [phone number]. Please, come quick!
OPERATOR: Okay, help is on the way. Why exactly what happened?
CALLER: He was joking with a gun, and it went off. Oh my God, help!
OPERATOR: Ma'am, I'm sending the paramedics to you now.
CALLER: Right away, please! He put the gun to his head and it just went off.
OPERATOR: Help is on the way. Stay with him and don't hang up the phone.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: Hello?
OPERATOR: Hello, do you have a police, fire, or medical emergency?
CALLER: Oh, yeah. Are you going to help me? Because I'm bleeding. A lot.
OPERATOR: Where are you bleeding?
CALLER: It's on my head. I have a problem with my eye. I'm bleeding so bad I can't see. I think you broke my jaw and my hand definitely.
OPERATOR: Okay, try to put something on the eye to stop the bleeding.
CALLER: I don't think I can see from this eye. There's blood going everywhere.
CALLER: He's beating me with something. I'm bleeding to death.
OPERATOR: What's happening? Where is he now?
CALLER: I think I'm going to die at this point. We have medical on the way, too, okay?
CALLER: I won't be able to open the door. He's going to try to kill me, my husband. Please help.
OPERATOR: Is he black, white, Hispanic, or Asian? How old is he?
CALLER: I'm trying to get a chance to see. I don't know. I can't see because of the blood.
OPERATOR: Okay. Is he still armed? Does he have any other weapons?
CALLER: I don't know. I don't think so.
CALLER: He's going to get in the house. We have dogs in the backyard. Please help me.
OPERATOR: Can you give me a further description of your husband? Is he medium-built, thin, or heavyset?
CALLER: He's medium-built. He's wearing green shorts.
OPERATOR: Okay. Do you have any guns in the house or anything like that?
CALLER: No. He's an ex-con.
CALLER: I'm bleeding a lot and he's going to come after me again.
OPERATOR: We have medical on the way. Stay with me, okay?
OPERATOR: Ma'am, can you see out of the other eye?
CALLER: Yes, but barely. The ice is on my eye.
OPERATOR: Okay, help is coming. Hang in there.
OPERATOR: Roll medical now, expedite medical. Severe head injury.
OPERATOR: Ma'am, go get the trauma pad out of the ambulance or the squad car. We've got medical on the way.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: 9-1-1, please send fire and medical.
OPERATOR: Pardon me?
CALLER: Somebody got shot.
OPERATOR: Somebody got shot?
CALLER: Yeah, out here in Mountain Dell.
OPERATOR: Okay, can you tell me more about what's happening?
CALLER: They're still shooting. Oh my god, they're still shooting.
OPERATOR: Are they shooting at someone?
CALLER: Yes, and a neighbor ran over and said the guy with them is shooting.
OPERATOR: Are they trying to shoot at them?
CALLER: No, I'm scared.
OPERATOR: Okay, ma'am, I need you to take a deep breath, okay? I'm already getting help started. Please take a deep breath and tell me what's going on.
CALLER: Mountain Dell Road. I'm so scared.
OPERATOR: Who is it that is shooting?
CALLER: Um, I don't know.
OPERATOR: Ma'am, I need to know who's shooting.
CALLER: The lady is coming over, and I'm afraid to go outside.
OPERATOR: Don't go outside. Do you know who is shooting?
CALLER: No, I don't know.
OPERATOR: Okay, someone has been shot?
CALLER: I don't know. I can't go out. I'm afraid.
OPERATOR: Who's shooting?
CALLER: It's just the neighbor. She's in my driveway, but she's yelling to call for an ambulance.
OPERATOR: She's the one that shot someone?
CALLER: Her boyfriend shot someone.
OPERATOR: Her boyfriend shot someone?
CALLER: Yes, she said to get an ambulance quick.
OPERATOR: Okay, we have help coming. So did he intentionally shoot someone?
CALLER: I think so.
OPERATOR: But you don't know why or who has been shot?
CALLER: No, I just know her son ran over and now she's parked in our driveway.
OPERATOR: So the female neighbor ran over, but her boyfriend did the shooting?
CALLER: Well, no, her son did at first, but then her boyfriend is the one that shot.
OPERATOR: Okay, do you know their names?
CALLER: Her boyfriend is Brian.
OPERATOR: Brian is shot. Who did the shooting?
CALLER: I don't know who did the shooting. She just said get an ambulance.
OPERATOR: Okay, is there an active shooter out there right now?
CALLER: I don't know anything. She just needs an ambulance.
OPERATOR: Do you know where he was shot?
CALLER: No, I don't know.
OPERATOR: Are they all out in your driveway right now?
CALLER: Yes, they're in their car. I can't see any gun.
OPERATOR: What kind of car are they in?
CALLER: It's an aqua blue car.
OPERATOR: Is it a sedan?
CALLER: Yes, I think so. They just need an ambulance quick.
OPERATOR: Help is on the way, but we can't approach until we know it's safe. Is anyone still shooting?
CALLER: I don't know. The people in the car don't have a gun.
OPERATOR: Okay, so someone at the house across the street has a gun, but the people in the car are safe?
CALLER: Yes, no weapons in the car. Just send an ambulance.
OPERATOR: Do you know why her boyfriend was shot?
CALLER: No, she just said get an ambulance quick.
OPERATOR: We're sending help, but we need to know what else is going on. Who else is involved?
CALLER: I don't know. It's just the three of them that live there.
OPERATOR: Can you tell me the name of the victim?
CALLER: Brian, I don't know his last name.
OPERATOR: Do you know anything about his injuries?
CALLER: No, I just know the girlfriend is in her car in my driveway.
OPERATOR: What's the girlfriend's name?
CALLER: I don't know her last name.
OPERATOR: Do you know if the son is in the car?
CALLER: I think it's just Brian in the car.
OPERATOR: What's the son's name?
CALLER: I don't know. I just know there's no gun in the car.
OPERATOR: Okay, we're sending help, but please stay inside and safe.
CALLER: Thank you, it's just so scary.
OPERATOR: I understand, ma'am. Help is on the way.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: Hi, my wife's pregnant and she said she can't make it to the hospital.
OPERATOR: Okay, I have somebody already dispatching units to you, okay? I'm going to ask you some questions.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Are you with her right now?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: How old is she?
CALLER: She's 36.
OPERATOR: Okay. Is she conscious?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Is she breathing?
CALLER: Yes, her water just broke.
OPERATOR: Her water just broke? How many weeks pregnant is she?
CALLER: She's 37 weeks.
OPERATOR: Is the baby completely out?
CALLER: No, I don't see any part of the baby yet.
OPERATOR: Okay, is she having contractions?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Is this her first delivery?
CALLER: No, this will be our third baby.
OPERATOR: Okay. How many minutes apart are her contractions?
CALLER: They're between two and five minutes apart.
OPERATOR: Is there any serious bleeding?
CALLER: No, I don't see any serious bleeding.
OPERATOR: Okay. Does she have any high-risk complications?
CALLER: No.
OPERATOR: I'm sending the paramedics to help you now. Stay on the line. I'll tell you exactly what to do next.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Do not try to prevent the birth. Do not sit her on the toilet. Allow her to assume the most comfortable position and have her take deep breaths between the contractions.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Have you called her healthcare provider?
CALLER: No, not yet.
OPERATOR: Okay. More water is coming out right now?
CALLER: Yes, I see more water coming out.
OPERATOR: You said this was her third pregnancy. Can you see the baby's head?
CALLER: Yes, I can see the baby's head.
OPERATOR: Okay, listen carefully and do exactly as I say. Lay her on her back in the center of the bed or on the floor.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Make sure all the clothing below her waist is removed. Raise her head with pillows, but do not let her sit up or go to the bathroom.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Get towels and check for pushing efforts. Get some dry towels and a blanket to wrap the baby in. You're going to need a string or a shoelace to tie around the umbilical cord after the delivery.
CALLER: I'm getting my shoelace off right now.
OPERATOR: When the baby is born, just have it available.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Is she pushing or straining yet?
CALLER: No, she's not pushing yet.
OPERATOR: Okay. With each contraction, you should place your palm against the baby's head and apply firm but gentle pressure to keep the baby's head from delivering too fast.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: As the baby delivers, support the baby's head and shoulders and hold the hips and legs firmly. Remember the baby will be slippery, don't drop it.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Is the baby out?
CALLER: Yes, the baby is out.
OPERATOR: Is the baby crying?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Okay, gently wipe off the baby's mouth and nose. Dry the baby off with a clean towel, then wrap the baby in the clean, dry towel and cover the baby's head but not its face.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Without pulling the cord tight, put the baby in the mother's arms or on her belly. Be sure to keep the baby and the mom warm.
CALLER: Got it.
OPERATOR: Do you have the shoelace?
CALLER: Yes, I have it.
OPERATOR: Listen carefully, and I'll tell you what to do next. Without pulling on the cord, tie the shoelace tightly around the umbilical cord about six inches from the baby but do not cut it.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Now we're going to deliver the afterbirth. Do not pull on the cord. The afterbirth should be delivering soon. Tell me if anything changes.
CALLER: Okay. I see some bleeding.
OPERATOR: Yes, she will bleed a bit. Do not pull on the cord. Let it come naturally.
CALLER: Okay, understood.
OPERATOR: Do you have a little baby girl or a boy?
CALLER: It's a boy.
OPERATOR: Congratulations! How's his color?
CALLER: He's very pink.
OPERATOR: Great. Check her vagina again. Do you see the afterbirth?
CALLER: I see the afterbirth is still inside.
OPERATOR: Is there any serious bleeding or cramping?
CALLER: No, it doesn't look serious.
OPERATOR: Okay, you're doing great. Just stay right where you are and keep the baby wrapped up. The paramedics should be arriving soon.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: If she feels like she has to push to get the placenta out, let her push.
CALLER: Will do.
OPERATOR: Hi, what's your name?
CALLER: Dina.
OPERATOR: Hi Dina, my name is Janet. You've done a great job.
CALLER: Thank you.
OPERATOR: You mentioned this was your third baby? Were all your other babies born this quickly?
CALLER: No, they took longer.
OPERATOR: That's okay. The paramedics are almost there. Just try to keep calm and breathe. You're both doing great.
CALLER: Okay.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: Well, it's not an emergency, but do you know why on one side at the damn drawbridge on 95 traffic can stop for 15 minutes?
OPERATOR: Are you calling 911 to complain about traffic?
CALLER: Yeah, somebody gave me a hard time. I called your number to find out why there's a delay. It's been about 22 minutes on the drawbridge, and I'm in the front car, and I can see something happening on the bridge.
OPERATOR: Sir, what's your complaint? What exactly is the issue you're calling about?
CALLER: I pulled up to the drawbridge, the light goes red. I think it's malfunctioning because there's nothing happening on the drawbridge.
OPERATOR: Okay. So there's traffic coming, and you're trying to go left on the drawbridge, correct?
CALLER: Yes, and there's been traffic coming the other way for the last 23 minutes, but nothing is happening. The light is red, there's a drop gate with six blinking lights, but no bridge going up.
OPERATOR: Did you call 911 just to report this issue?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Okay, well, the person you spoke to before was trying to explain that 911 is for emergencies only, not for traffic issues.
CALLER: No, but this isn't just traffic. This is a serious malfunction affecting a lot of people.
OPERATOR: I understand, but is it creating just a traffic backup or is there more to it?
CALLER: It's more than a backup. This is absurd. We're all just stuck here with no idea what's going on.
OPERATOR: Unfortunately, sir, we don't have control over the drawbridge. You might want to contact VDOT or Maryland's Department of Transportation. We can't help with traffic signals or bridge malfunctions.
CALLER: I live in Alexandria, but I'm not even on the Alexandria side right now.
OPERATOR: I understand. Contacting the state departments responsible for the bridge might give you more answers.
CALLER: All right.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: Please help me. I'm Amanda Berry.

CALLER: Alright.
OPERATOR: Kneel next to her and look into her mouth for food or vomit. Is there anything in her mouth?
CALLER: No.

OPERATOR: That's right. Put your ear next to her mouth. Can you feel or hear any breathing?
CALLER: No.
OPERATOR: Okay. We'll have to start CPR. With the baby's head slightly tilted back, completely cover her mouth and nose with your mouth, and blow two puffs of air into her lungs about one second each, just enough to make the chest rise. Did you feel the air going in and out?
CALLER: I'm trying. One second.
OPERATOR: You need to do two puffs of air into the lungs, about one second each.
CALLER: Okay, done.

CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Now push down about an inch and a half with only your fingers touching the chest. Pump the chest hard and fast 30 times, at least twice per second. Let the chest come all the way up between pumps. Tell me when you're done.
CALLER: Alright, counting...
OPERATOR: Count out loud to 30.
CALLER: One, two, three, four... Thirty.
OPERATOR: Now with your hand under her neck and shoulders, tilt her head back and give her two more puffs of air.
CALLER: Two more puffs. Got it.
OPERATOR: Then pump the chest 30 more times. Tell me when you're done.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Make sure your fingers are on the breastbone between the nipples. Have you done 30 pumps?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Now give her two more puffs of air. Then pump the chest 30 times again. Let me know when you're finished.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Keep going. Two puffs, then 30 pumps.
CALLER: Did it.
OPERATOR: Is she showing any signs of breathing now?
CALLER: No, I don't think so.
OPERATOR: Keep repeating this cycle. Two puffs, 30 pumps. Help is on the way.
CALLER: Okay, I'm doing it.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: Representative Bogdanov, you're on deck.
CALLER: Representative Domino is here to talk about emergency dispatchers, 911 dispatchers.
OPERATOR: Welcome to the Health Care Council. You're recognized.
CALLER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members. This bill upon passage will allow for a certification process for emergency dispatchers.
CALLER: Currently, 31 other states have such a process. It will recognize a 208-hour DOE-approved course as a minimum standard.
CALLER: The goal is to ensure that first responders are dispatched to emergencies and catastrophic events with a higher level of quality, efficiency, and minimized human errors.
CALLER: Our emergency dispatchers do a great job, but having all 67 counties follow the same standards will be helpful.
CALLER: We have some dramatic testimonies to support the need for this legislation.
OPERATOR: Very good. Are there any questions for Representative Domino on the bill?
OPERATOR: Let's go to public testimony. Representative Domino, do you want to call folks in a particular order?
CALLER: No particular order.
OPERATOR: Very good. Randy Touchton, you are up.
CALLER: Thank you. Florida Professional Firefighters Association waves in support.
OPERATOR: Armand Nalt, please come up.
CALLER: Thank you. Firefighters and paramedics from Palm Beach County support this bill.
OPERATOR: Gary Rainey, you're next.
CALLER: Thank you. From Miami, Florida, representing the Florida professional firefighters.
OPERATOR: Lisa Henning, please come forwards.
CALLER: I am with the Fraternal Order of Police here in Tallahassee, and I support this bill.
OPERATOR: Richard Goff, you're next.
CALLER: Good morning. My name is Richard Goff, a 25-year law enforcement veteran and father of Denise Lee.
CALLER: My daughter was kidnapped, raped, and murdered. The culprit drove her around, and she managed to get the attention of a bystander who called 911.
CALLER: The bystander gave a description of the car and the suspect, but our dispatch failed to relay this information to the road deputies.
CALLER: We had over six agencies, two helicopters, and approximately 30 people looking for her. She was found later buried in a shallow grave.
CALLER: The internal investigation found fault with two dispatchers, but the consequences were minor. I urge you to pass this bill.
OPERATOR: Thank you, Mr. Goff. Our hearts go out to you and your family. Amy Campbell, you're next.
CALLER: I am from Orlando, Florida, representing the Orange County Sheriff's Office, and I wave in support.
OPERATOR: Richard Pinsky, please come forwards.
CALLER: I am from West Palm Beach and represent 911 emergency dispatchers. I support this bill.
OPERATOR: Is there anyone else wishing to testify on House Bill 997?
OPERATOR: We'll now move into debate. Representative Hayes, you are recognized.
CALLER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am deeply disturbed that this is only voluntary certification. We should look into making this mandatory in the future.
CALLER: We need our 911 operators to be properly trained and certified. I support this bill, but it should go further.
OPERATOR: Representative Harrell, you are recognized.
CALLER: Thank you. My heart goes out to the Goff family. The importance of training for dispatchers in both health care and law enforcement cannot be overstated.
CALLER: Often, 911 calls are health-related, and those dispatchers need appropriate training. This should be the standard across the state and be required.
OPERATOR: Representative Hudson, you are recognized.
CALLER: Thank you, Chairman. As a parent, I am speechless at Mr. Goff's testimony. Consistency in process is crucial across all counties to ensure quality information is disseminated efficiently.
CALLER: Our first responders deserve the best support. I support this bill.
OPERATOR: Representative Anderson, you are recognized.
CALLER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I compliment Representative Domino for bringing this important bill forward. Communication and proper training are essential.
CALLER: I agree that this certification should eventually be mandatory.
OPERATOR: Representative Domino, would you like to close?
CALLER: Thank you. As mentioned, 28 states have mandatory certification, and some have voluntary. We have to start somewhere.
CALLER: This bill will save lives and significantly help in emergency situations. I urge your support.
OPERATOR: Thank you, Representative Domino. The clerk will now call the roll on House Bill 997.
OPERATOR: House Bill 997 will be reported favorably as a council substitute. Thank you, members.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, this call is recorded. What's your emergency?
CALLER: Hello.
OPERATOR: Hi, this is the state police. A gentleman's girlfriend is having a baby right now.
CALLER: Okay, sir. What's the address?
OPERATOR: 101 Beach. B-E-E-C-H. It's in Belmont.
CALLER: 101 Beach. Is that a multifamily house?

CALLER: Okay, he's coming out. Oh, hi, little guy?

CALLER: He's out? All right, sir.

OPERATOR: How's his color?
CALLER: He's white. He looks okay.
OPERATOR: Okay. Is he breathing?
CALLER: Yeah. He looks like he's asleep.
OPERATOR: Okay. Stay on the phone with me. How many months along was she?
CALLER: Nine months.
OPERATOR: She was nine months along? Okay. Is he crying?
CALLER: Yeah. A little bit.
OPERATOR: Excellent. Do you see any obvious problems at all?
CALLER: No, his eyes are still closed.
OPERATOR: That's fine. Okay. You just want to very gently wipe off the baby's mouth and nose with a clean cloth.
CALLER: Okay, dry off the baby with a clean towel?
OPERATOR: Yes, just dry him off very gently.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Very good. That's a good sound.
CALLER: Thank you.
OPERATOR: You want to cover the baby's head with the clean towel to keep him warm but don't cover his face. Also, don't pull the cord tight.
CALLER: I'm not pulling the cord. Should I put the baby in the mother's arms or on her belly?
OPERATOR: Yes, place the baby in the mother's arms or on her belly. The big thing right now is to keep the baby warm and the mother too.
CALLER: Okay, fine. Yeah.
OPERATOR: I have the paramedics and the EMTs on the way.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: They will be there in a couple of minutes. I'll stay on the phone with you until they arrive. Is the door to the apartment unlocked, sir?
CALLER: It is now.
OPERATOR: It is unlocked now? Okay. He's crying.
CALLER: The fire department is on the third floor.
OPERATOR: The fire department is arriving outside; they're going to come right up. I'm staying on the phone with you until they make contact.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: You did a great job.
CALLER: We're here. Thanks so much.
OPERATOR: How's it going?
CALLER: Thank you so much, sir.
OPERATOR: All right, sir. Go ahead and hang up with me.
CALLER: Okay. You're welcome. Bye-bye.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: I think someone's trying to break into my home, just off of 56th Avenue.
CALLER: He broke a window, and I'm home alone.
CALLER: I'm 14.
OPERATOR: Just a window, but I don't know what he can do next. Who is he?
CALLER: I don't know.
CALLER: It's dangerous.
OPERATOR: You're 14?
CALLER: I think I saw.
CALLER: I'm 14 and I'm all alone.
OPERATOR: Which window did he break?
CALLER: One in the back.
CALLER: He already tried opening the door. That's when I heard him.
OPERATOR: Did you see anyone?
CALLER: Just a single male in a black tank top. That's all I can really give right now as a description.
OPERATOR: And they tried to open the door in the back?
CALLER: Yes.
CALLER: I heard the door being pounded. I heard the knob trying to be turned.
OPERATOR: Do you know if he's a white, black, or Latin male?
CALLER: Probably, I can't see now. Maybe he went away, but probably, oh, I'm going to say white. Definitely not black, but I can't tell if he was Latino or white.
CALLER: And there's not much in terms of weapons in my house, so I don't have much to defend myself.
OPERATOR: What was he wearing?
CALLER: A black tank top, and I think he had something in his hand. Whether it was a hammer or a crowbar, I couldn't tell. But I could see the glass shattering. Maybe he just did that and ran away, but I don't really know right now.
CALLER: My parents are on their way home, but they're coming from Miami, so I don't know when they're going to get home.
OPERATOR: Okay, they're coming from Miami?
CALLER: Yes, my brother is moving out of college today, so...
OPERATOR: What type of vehicle are they driving?
CALLER: Considering both vehicles are gone, I would say a white Kia Sorento, a dark blue Dodge Journey, or a golden Hyundai Sonata.
CALLER: Oh, definitely. He's coming in right now. You hear the glass? He's coming in.
CALLER: Yes, he's coming in. I need to see him. Definitely white, black, black tank top.
OPERATOR: Where are you at now?
CALLER: I'm in the front room with my shoe horn as a weapon.
OPERATOR: Do you hear anything?
CALLER: Yes. You know the front door.
OPERATOR: Can you go in a room and lock it?
CALLER: Yes, that's something we can do right now. I am now in my bedroom.
OPERATOR: Okay, where is your bedroom located in the house?
CALLER: We have a long central hallway, and if you go down from coming in from the front door, it's the second door on the right.
OPERATOR: Is it on the east side of the house or the west side?
CALLER: I'm sorry, ma'am, I can't say that right now. I don't know.
OPERATOR: Okay, so you don't know if it's on the east side or west side of the house?
CALLER: No, I'm sorry, but it's on the opposite side of the kitchen.
OPERATOR: Do you still hear someone?
CALLER: Yes.
CALLER: Ma'am, is it okay if I can...
OPERATOR: What?
OPERATOR: Where do you hear the person at?
CALLER: In the backyard, still banging glass.
OPERATOR: Still in the backyard?
CALLER: Yeah, I don't think he's in yet. I don't hear anything now.
OPERATOR: Okay, and your room is on the opposite side of the kitchen?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Okay, and you can't tell if your room is towards the east side?
CALLER: I'm very sorry, I haven't called them yet. I called you first.
OPERATOR: Okay, you said your parents are on their way home?
CALLER: Yes, I was thinking of putting you on speaker and sending them a quick text saying, hurry back.
OPERATOR: So you heard them in the back, in the backyard?
CALLER: Mm-hmm, in the backyard.
OPERATOR: Okay. Can you go to the back?
CALLER: No, I'm not going to scare them.
OPERATOR: Okay, the officers are telling me now that they are in the back. They want you to go to the back.
CALLER: Okay, there should be a large oak tree, or maybe two oaks.
OPERATOR: Yes, the officer is in the back of the house.
CALLER: Yellowish house?
OPERATOR: Yes, go to the back.
CALLER: Wait, wait a minute. Does the officer see the broken glass window?
OPERATOR: Yes.
CALLER: Okay, so maybe he ran away from the cops, I don't know.
CALLER: So the officer wants me to go to the back?
OPERATOR: Yes, go to the back.
OPERATOR: Are you on a cordless phone? Can you go with the phone?
CALLER: No, I'm on my cell phone.
OPERATOR: Okay, go to the back door with your phone.
CALLER: Wait, someone's in the house. I don't know if it's my family or not.
OPERATOR: Somebody's inside the house?
CALLER: Yes, I hear someone yell.
OPERATOR: Okay, stay inside your room.
CALLER: Okay.
CALLER: Ma'am?
OPERATOR: Yes?
CALLER: My bedroom should be the only door closed right now.
OPERATOR: Okay, your bedroom door should be the only door closed.
OPERATOR: You said your bedroom is the second door from the front?
CALLER: Yes, if you come in from the front door, there is a hallway.
OPERATOR: Okay.
CALLER: If you come in the front door, there's a long hallway, and it's the second door across from the kitchen.
OPERATOR: No, you come through the front door, you take your first right, and you look left, there's a hallway.
CALLER: If you walk forward from the front door, take a few steps, turn right, and go down, then turn left. There's a long hallway. My door would be the first on your right.
OPERATOR: Okay, hold on a second.
OPERATOR: Is there a window in your room?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: How many windows are on your side of the house in your room?
CALLER: Quite a few. There's a fenced-in, greenery area where our dogs used to run around. My room is on that side.
CALLER: I see someone. I don't know if it's an officer or not.
OPERATOR: Okay, do you see them clearly?
CALLER: Oh, I see an officer. I see an officer.
OPERATOR: The officer is at your window?
CALLER: He's not necessarily at my window, but he's at the front of the fenced-in area.
OPERATOR: The officer is in front of the fence?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Can you come out through the door by your parents' bedroom?
CALLER: There's, I'm coming out right now.

CALLER: But I didn't mean to. Because when he rushed me the first time, I don't know where the first shot went. Then he took off his shirt and charged me again. I told him to go and I shot him. I had my two kids and my wife here. I didn't know what he was doing.

CALLER: Right before I left. We said goodbye, she gave me a kiss, and I drove off.
OPERATOR: I have EMS and the fire department coming out there.
CALLER: She had both outside lights on; that's unusual for her.

CALLER: Yes, I'm in the driveway. Please tell them to hurry.

OPERATOR: Was it that silver car?
CALLER: No, that was a lady who got in that one.

CALLER: Hang on a second. It looked like a gray bandana around his mouth and over his eyes.
OPERATOR: So not a mask?
CALLER: I don't know for sure. There's a guy waiting in the car.
OPERATOR: So there's another person in the white car?
CALLER: Yeah, there's a person waiting. The police are pulling right behind him right now.

CALLER: You just follow Eagle Road on out.

I already told her, I already asked her, maybe I have to come down before they make it and get my sandwiches that way, because it seems like they're not listening to me. They just put down anything they want and then they expect me to pay for it.
OPERATOR: Okay, in the future, just don't, you can stay there, stay outside, I'll send somebody.

CALLER: In there. He's in there?

OPERATOR: He shot one, and now he's helping her up?
CALLER: Yeah. He shot both of them, and now he's helping them.

CALLER: Something is wrong.
OPERATOR: 911. What's the address of the emergency?
CALLER: Leopold Way, 3308. Someone came into my house and tried to attack me, and I had a pistol and I shot.
OPERATOR: And you're at 3308, you said? That's not a valid address.
CALLER: I mean, I can't. It's on Leopold's Way and Todd Drive.
OPERATOR: What's the phone number you're calling from?
CALLER: Can you please send someone?
OPERATOR: Yeah, I'll get officers on the way. What's your name?
CALLER: My name is Perry Lucas.
OPERATOR: Stay on the line with me.
CALLER: Okay. I'm just getting out of the way because these are thug-type people that came into my house, and when I took out a gun and...
OPERATOR: What apartment are you in?
CALLER: Apartment number three.
OPERATOR: No, that's fine. I'll get you some help, okay? So you were attacked, and then you retaliated and shot them?
CALLER: Yes.
CALLER: Someone started acting crazy, and they attacked my girlfriend. I told them to leave. They didn't leave, and then they told me to leave. I told them I live here. Then the guy ran at me, and I shot him.
OPERATOR: So you said the gun is unloaded and put away?
CALLER: Yes, I separated the ammo from the gun.
OPERATOR: Alright, where do you have the gun now?
CALLER: It’s tucked away in the plant holder inside.

CALLER: Yeah, I was sleeping and I heard my doorbell ring.
OPERATOR: Okay, do you believe that somebody's in your house right now?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Okay, what do you hear?
CALLER: I heard creaking on my floor. First, I heard a bang.
OPERATOR: Where are you at in your house? Are you somewhere safe?
CALLER: I'm upstairs.
OPERATOR: Was there supposed to be anybody in your house?
CALLER: No.
OPERATOR: Okay. Stay on the phone. I'm just getting some more information to send help. What exactly did you hear?
CALLER: I heard creaking across my floor.
OPERATOR: You heard somebody walking across the floor?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Are you in the upper level of the house or on a main floor?
CALLER: I'm in the upper level.
OPERATOR: What do I hear in the background?
CALLER: It's my husband on my phone. He's telling me to lock the bedroom door.
OPERATOR: Did you lock your bedroom door?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Okay, what do you hear now? Do you hear anything at all?
CALLER: No, I haven't heard anything else.
OPERATOR: Do you have any pets in your house?
CALLER: Yes, I have a dog, but she's new and she's real skittish. She doesn’t usually bark much.

CALLER: She's with me.
OPERATOR: So your dog is with you and sitting still?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: And you have your husband on a cell phone as well?
CALLER: Yes, my cell phone.

CALLER: Yes, I heard the doorbell, then a knock, and then a loud thud.
OPERATOR: Alright, we have help on the way. Stay on the line with me.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: Um, all your doctors? Because my mom's on the floor, we think, and I can't wake her up.
OPERATOR: How old is your mommy?
CALLER: Um, I don't know, but she's not waking up.
CALLER: I always try to wake her up and the baby is crying.
CALLER: I was crying my head off.
OPERATOR: Okay, can you do me a favor, sweetie? Is your mom on her stomach or her back?
CALLER: I don't know.
OPERATOR: When you look at your mommy, is she laying on her stomach?
CALLER: No, she's laying on her side.
OPERATOR: Okay, can you roll her flat on her back? Can you push her over?
CALLER: No, she's too big. But are you a doctor?
OPERATOR: No, but honey, I am going to get someone out to you. I want you to stay on the phone with me.
OPERATOR: How long has your mommy been sleeping?
CALLER: I don't know. She just stayed like this. I was trying to get her up and the baby is crying. I don't know how to make... um... I tried calling somebody, but they didn't answer.
OPERATOR: Okay. So she's been like that for a couple of hours?
CALLER: Yeah.
OPERATOR: Is that your baby brother or sister?
CALLER: Yeah. I can't make him a bottle. I don't know how.
OPERATOR: Okay, you can't make him a bottle. How old is your brother or sister?
CALLER: Oh, my sister's not here. She's at my dad's and the baby is two weeks old.
OPERATOR: The baby is two weeks old?
CALLER: Yeah.
OPERATOR: Okay, sweetie. What's the bottle look like? Do you know where the bottles are?
CALLER: I know where one bottle is, but can you really hear me? The baby's crying.
OPERATOR: I can hear you, sweetie. I can hear you really good. You're doing a great job. Does your baby brother take a baby bottle or a pacifier?
CALLER: We have cereal for him and I was trying to make the cereal, but I don't know how. The box is not open.
OPERATOR: Okay, okay, you're doing great. Is your baby brother in a little sling, or is he laying in a crib?
CALLER: No, he's in his little chair.
OPERATOR: In his little chair? Is it a bouncy chair?
CALLER: Yes, but I was trying to wake her up. I'm so tired. I'm afraid we stayed up all night.
OPERATOR: Oh, honey, you're not going to stay up all night. We're going to get someone to help you. You're being so brave right now. I'm so proud of you. How old are you?
CALLER: Five.
OPERATOR: Five. You are doing great. What's your name?
CALLER: Austin.
OPERATOR: Austin, you are being a great helper. Do you like your new baby brother?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: What's his name?
CALLER: Um, his name is Aiden.
OPERATOR: Baby Aiden?
CALLER: Yeah.
OPERATOR: Can you show me what the bottle looks like because your mom's not waking up somehow?
CALLER: Okay, that's fine. You can take the phone with you. Tell me what the bottle looks like.
CALLER: It has stuff in it, but it has the stuff in it. It has the formula, and I was shaking it, but somehow the lid didn't close.
OPERATOR: Is there water in the bottle with the formula?
CALLER: Yeah, you have to put it in. That's how you make it.
OPERATOR: You are very smart. That is how we make bottles. Did you twist the top on all the way?
CALLER: Yeah, but when I was shaking it, it didn't mix.
OPERATOR: It's okay. Sometimes it takes a little longer. If it's twisted on right, with the little eating part you suck out of, we can shake it again together. We'll shake together.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Are you shaking it now?
CALLER: No, I don't have it right now.
OPERATOR: Can you take the phone with you? We want to try and help baby Aiden.
CALLER: This is a house phone, but I can't bring the whole phone.
OPERATOR: Okay, okay, can you set the phone down and go get the bottle and come back?
CALLER: Okay.
CALLER: Okay, I'm back.
OPERATOR: Okay, I'm still here, honey. Did you get the bottle?
CALLER: Yeah, I have it.
OPERATOR: Okay, does it look more like formula now?
CALLER: No, there's still formula at the bottom.
OPERATOR: Okay, well let's shake it really hard.
CALLER: I'm shaking it.
OPERATOR: You are doing good. Sometimes the formula likes to get stuck.
CALLER: I was watching a movie and I told her to get up and she didn't. She's done this two or three times already.
OPERATOR: You're doing so good. I'm so proud of you. I'm sure your mommy is proud of you too for being such a good help.
CALLER: I'm trying to wake her up. She's not waking up.
OPERATOR: Okay. If you put your hand in front of her nose or her mouth, can you feel any breath?
CALLER: Okay, I'll do that. Hold on.
CALLER: I don't know because there's a new phone and I don't know if she's breathing.
OPERATOR: Okay. Does she have any red stuff by her body?
CALLER: No.
OPERATOR: No blood? Do you know what blood looks like?
CALLER: I know it's red.
OPERATOR: Okay. You don't see any of that?
CALLER: No.
OPERATOR: Okay. All right. Well, we're doing good. How's that bottle looking?
CALLER: It still has formula at the bottom. I'll try to shake it when you come because I'm trying to make him one and it's not working.
OPERATOR: Okay, that's all right. If we shake it up, does it have enough liquid so he can get some milk maybe?
CALLER: I think my mom put too much and that's why it's not working, I think.
OPERATOR: Oh, okay. Well, can we just try and dump a little bit out so we can give him a little bit?
CALLER: Hold on. Set the phone down.
CALLER: It's probably the paramedics. Set the phone down and get the door. Do you see fire trucks?
CALLER: Okay. My mom's laying on the floor.
CALLER: They're in the kitchen now.
CALLER: No, I'm just scared because the door is right there.
CALLER: My phone is ringing. My phone is ringing.
OPERATOR: Okay. Hey, Austin?
CALLER: Yeah.
OPERATOR: Help is on the way, okay? They're going to help you.
OPERATOR: Say hi.
CALLER: Okay.
CALLER: Hello. They're here.
OPERATOR: Is there someone with you? Can you show them the bottle? Maybe they can make it for your brother?
CALLER: Yeah, he is right now. He's making the bottle.
OPERATOR: Okay. All right. They're going to help you, okay?
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: All right. Bye.
CALLER: Bye.

CALLER: Yes, I understand.
OPERATOR: Two victims, one inside and one out back. Can you tell me the condition of the person outside?
CALLER: I have no clue.
OPERATOR: What color shirts were the suspects wearing?
CALLER: One was in a blue shirt, and the other was in a dark green shirt.
OPERATOR: How about pants?
CALLER: The one in the blue shirt had camouflage pants.
OPERATOR: Okay, so blue shirt with camouflage pants. The one in the green shirt?
CALLER: He had tan shorts and shaggy hair.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: Hello, ma'am. My name is Jarius Jackson. I'm calling on behalf of my mother. She's on the phone right now.
CALLER: I'm in another country, Canada. She's at my home in Texas at 2711 Driftwood Drive, and she was a witness of a kidnapping tonight.
OPERATOR: Who was kidnapped?
CALLER: A woman she works with named Suzanne. She doesn't know her last name or too much about her. They just worked together and started talking today. The woman seemed very nervous all day.
CALLER: As they were walking to their cars, probably about 30-40 minutes ago, around 9:16, they were outside the store.
OPERATOR: Where did this kidnapping occur?
CALLER: It was near the Bed Bath and Beyond in Pearland, right by Walmart and Chase Bank.
OPERATOR: Okay, where do you all work at?
CALLER: They work at Catherine's.
OPERATOR: Can you provide directions to your house?
CALLER: Yes, if you are coming off 288, take the South Fork exit. Head into Silver Creek subdivision. Turn right at the first stop sign by the car dealership. Continue to the second entrance, which is Coral Drive, C-O-R-A-L. Make a left onto Coral, then a right at the next stop sign, which I think is Tumbling Falls. Follow it to the next stop sign, make another right, and continue until you can make a left.
CALLER: When you make that left, go to the stop sign. You will then make another right, and then a left onto Skyline Drive, which eventually turns into Driftwood. 2711 Driftwood, second house on the left.
CALLER: My mom is scared to death because these people kidnapped Suzanne. They parked near my mom and had a guy with a mask, gloves, and a gun.
CALLER: The guy asked my mom if she had a cell phone, and she said she didn't have one. He then told Suzanne to get into the car.
OPERATOR: Did the guy have a mask on?
CALLER: Yes, he had a mask, gloves, and a silver gun. He told Suzanne to get into the car, and she complied. My mom quickly drove off after that.
OPERATOR: Is your mom still on the phone?
CALLER: Yes, her name is Karen Jackson.
OPERATOR: Okay, let her know we have an officer on the way to your house.
CALLER: Thank you.

CALLER: I don't think I can do it.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: Uh, burglars are breaking into a house next door.
OPERATOR: What's the address there, sir?
CALLER: 7418. Not my address, but next door, okay?
OPERATOR: Yes, sir. Do you want me to stop them?
CALLER: I've got a shotgun. Do you want me to stop them?

CALLER: I'm not hanging up, but I'm telling you right now, I don't like this. This is ridiculous.
OPERATOR: I understand, but we don't want you getting hurt. Do you see which window they went through?
CALLER: The side, on the side where the gate is. You know, where the fence is, because nobody can see them.
OPERATOR: So that would be the right-hand side, looking from the front?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Man, this is scary. I can't believe this is happening in this neighborhood. Can you see anything at all?
CALLER: No, I just see where they went in the house. I can't see inside the house.
OPERATOR: I understand that, but you can see where they entered?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: So they might slip out the same way. Can you see the front of the house?
CALLER: I can't see the front. I'll bring my shotgun with me, I swear to God.
OPERATOR: Don't go out there. Stay inside the house.
CALLER: If I go out there, what am I going to have?
OPERATOR: No, I don't want you to go out there. I just asked if you could see anything out front, like a vehicle they arrived in?
CALLER: No.
OPERATOR: Alright. Let me know if you see anything at all. Stay inside and don't go out there. Are you still there, Mr. Horn?
CALLER: I'm here. I can't see the front of the house. I can't tell if they're getting away or not.
OPERATOR: That's alright. We have officers on the way. Do you know your neighbors well?
CALLER: No, not really. I know the neighbors on the other side well. If it was their house, I'd have done something already.
OPERATOR: Mr. Horn, listen to me carefully. We have officers on the way. Do not go outside the house and do not have that gun in your hand when officers are there.
CALLER: I have a right to protect myself, and the laws have changed. I have a right to protect my property.
OPERATOR: I understand, but it’s not worth risking your life over this.
CALLER: He's coming out the window right now. I've got to stop them.
OPERATOR: Don't go out the door. Mr. Horn, do not go outside.
CALLER: They just stole something. I'm going out the door.
OPERATOR: Don't go out the door. Do not go outside.
CALLER: This isn't right. They're getting away.
OPERATOR: Property is not worth killing someone over. Do not go outside. Don't be shooting anybody.
CALLER: They got a bag, they're walking out the driveway.
OPERATOR: How big is the bag? Which way are they going?
CALLER: I'm going outside to find out.
OPERATOR: Don't go outside, Mr. Horn.
CALLER: Here it goes. I'm going.
OPERATOR: 911, we need officers over here quickly. Did you shoot someone, Mr. Horn?
CALLER: Yes, I did.
OPERATOR: Where are you right now?
CALLER: I'm inside the house at 7418.

CALLER: I don't have the exact address, but I’m at the drive-thru. I placed an order, and when I got to the window, I told the lady I wanted lemonade. She said they don't have lemonade. I asked why she didn't tell me that before.
OPERATOR: Are you in the drive-thru or inside the store?
CALLER: I’m in the drive-thru.
OPERATOR: Are you blocking other customers?
CALLER: No, I’m in one of the spots. She’s making me wait for 15 minutes because she says I talk too much. The food is ready, but she's refusing to give it to me.
OPERATOR: What's your name?
CALLER: Jean Portion.
OPERATOR: Jean, if the food is not done, it’s not done. If they are asking you to move, you need to move. You don't call 911 because you're unhappy with your order.
CALLER: The food is ready, but she says she’s making me wait because I was a bad customer.
OPERATOR: Have you given them any money?
CALLER: No.
OPERATOR: Have they given you any food?
CALLER: No.
OPERATOR: Then you can drive away, sir. You don’t need to call 911 for this.
CALLER: I moved the car but I’m still hungry. Why are they refusing to give me the food?
OPERATOR: Sir, you can’t block their drive-thru. Just wait in the parking lot or leave. This is not a police matter.
CALLER: Okay, I’m moving the car.
OPERATOR: Are you still in the parking lot?
CALLER: Yes, but I don't like the way she’s treating customers. I’m here to buy food and she’s being rude.
OPERATOR: I understand, but this is not a reason to call 911. If you have a customer service issue, you need to speak to the management, not the police. 911 is for emergencies only.
CALLER: Okay, I understand.
OPERATOR: Do you need anything else?
CALLER: No, I just wanted to let you know. I’m leaving now.
OPERATOR: Alright, thank you. Please don’t call 911 for non-emergencies in the future.

CALLER: Um, well, I can smell something. I was doing some paperwork, turned around, and smelled it.
CALLER: I could see, like, you can tell there was a smell coming from the bag.
CALLER: The bag looked unusual, so I decided to take a closer look.
CALLER: There's a trash bag back there, and the only reason I checked is because it seemed out of place.
CALLER: So I decided to poke it a bit to see what was inside.
CALLER: I couldn't tell what it was at first, but then I saw a Hooters shirt. I could read 'Hooters' across the shirt.
OPERATOR: Okay. And is there definitely more than just clothing in there?
CALLER: Oh, yeah. At first it seemed like there might be something else, like a turtle or something.
CALLER: But when I saw the shirt material, I knew I should call.

OPERATOR: We can't keep sending officers all over the place if you keep moving. We need you to be stationary.
CALLER: Okay, I'm going back to McMickin.
OPERATOR: That's all we need. If charges need to be pressed, they'll find him and put a warrant out.
CALLER: But that's my baby, and he's on drugs.

CALLER: Well, it's like she was here yesterday, and, you know, her car was parked here, and she was supposedly sleeping in my son's room. And I guess he got panicky because she passed away. And so she just passed away yesterday. And I found out just about an hour ago, and I've been in a panic ever since.

CALLER: It's a Mercedes. Can you please come here?
OPERATOR: There's already deputies on the way, okay? I need you to calm down and take a deep breath. My asking you questions is not slowing them down. They're already on the way.

CALLER: Okay. I'll give you all the car information when they get here. I've been kidnapped. I've been gone for hours at gunpoint. I've been in the back seat of a car.

CALLER: My name is...
CALLER: How long before they come back? That's what we're worried about.

OPERATOR: Okay. And how long ago? I've been in a closet, locked up. Just stay on the phone with me in case they come back, okay, so that we know.
CALLER: Well, they're going to come back. We're not worried about that. The question is whether they come back before the cops get here and people get shot or...

OPERATOR: Did you see a vehicle, sir?
CALLER: I didn't see that he got out of a vehicle. All I saw was he crossed the street.

OPERATOR: Yes, that feeling is part of labor. Just keep her where she is and get her to breathe through it. We don't want her to push yet.
CALLER: Okay, so the head is coming out more?
OPERATOR: As the baby delivers, support the baby's head and shoulders and hold the hips and legs firmly. Remember, the baby is going to be slippery. Don't drop it. Tell me what's happening.
CALLER: Okay, she's relaxed right now.
CALLER: But the baby comes a little through every time.
OPERATOR: We just want to make sure it doesn't come out too fast. Is she pushing?
CALLER: No, she's not.
OPERATOR: Is the baby coming out?
CALLER: No, not yet.
CALLER: I feel a lot of blood.
OPERATOR: When the next contraction comes and she feels the urge to push, have her push hard to get the baby out.
CALLER: Okay, I see the forehead.
OPERATOR: Tell her to push hard and remember to support the baby's head and shoulders.
CALLER: Okay, the head is out, but the shoulders aren't.
OPERATOR: In fact, the paramedics are there, okay? Just focus on what you're doing right now.

OPERATOR: Okay, and he said he didn't want to get in trouble?
CALLER: No, I don't know if he's got a record or something, but when I saw the U-Haul, I knew their intentions, especially since I broke down two doors.
OPERATOR: It's going to be all right, ma'am. Just hold on.
CALLER: He asked me for cash, and I gave him about $5. He said he was calling the police, but I don't know if he really called you, so I called with my cell phone.

OPERATOR: I know, hon. Why did this have to happen?
CALLER: Van is one of the best people in the world. And they just shot him.

CALLER: I guess because he has nice cars in the driveway. I don't know. Please hurry up.
OPERATOR: I understand. I need you to stay put. Where are the cops?
CALLER: I hear sirens.
OPERATOR: Don't go out until I tell you. Stay put. Are you behind the barn?

CALLER: Wait a minute, ma'am, hurry.
OPERATOR: Listen to me. Is she awake? Is she breathing? What is she doing?
CALLER: She's not awake.
OPERATOR: Okay, did you give her the two breaths?
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Now, you need to start chest compressions. Put the heel of one hand in the center of her chest, right between her nipples, and push down about half the depth of the chest 30 times quickly.
CALLER: Thirty times quickly?
OPERATOR: Yes, 3-0.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: I have them on the way to you, okay? They're on the way to help you. Keep giving breaths and doing compressions.
CALLER: Okay.
CALLER: Oh, I can't.
OPERATOR: I understand, ma'am. We're coming.
OPERATOR: Did you do your 30 compressions?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Now you pinch the nose, lift the chin, and gently tilt the head back and give two breaths again. Then do 30 compressions again.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: Check if she's trying to cough or if she's responding.
CALLER: Okay, she's trying to.
OPERATOR: Check if she's breathing, is her chest rising? Check if she has a pulse.
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Is there anything else blocking her airway?
CALLER: No, ma'am.
OPERATOR: They're on the way, I promise. They're coming as fast as they can.
CALLER: Please help me, help me.
OPERATOR: Is somebody there with you?
CALLER: No, ma'am.
OPERATOR: What's going on? Is she responding?
CALLER: No, she's just trying to.
OPERATOR: Keep trying to wake her up. Make sure she has a pulse and see if her chest is rising.
CALLER: Who's there with you?
CALLER: The neighbor.
CALLER: I can hear the sirens, I'm going to go out and get them.
CALLER: Hello?
OPERATOR: Hello?
CALLER: Wait a minute, please.
CALLER: Hello?
OPERATOR: Yes?
CALLER: My neighbor is with her. Ma'am, is she breathing?
OPERATOR: Ma'am, hello?
CALLER: Yes, thank you.

OPERATOR: 9-1-1, what's your emergency?
CALLER: We heard a noise and looked in. The garage door was up. I thought the gentleman was backing out. I went back to my house, but he never backed out. I came back over, and his driver's side window is shattered, and he's injured and can't answer.
OPERATOR: Okay, and the phone number you're calling from?
CALLER: I'm calling from [caller provides phone number].
OPERATOR: Okay, tell me exactly what happened.
CALLER: He's inside. I don't know if somebody tried to shoot him, if he shot himself, or what. I don't know.
OPERATOR: Was that at this location, correct?
CALLER: Yes, send an ambulance in a hurry. An EMT. He's still alive. He's moving.
OPERATOR: Okay. What's going on with him?
CALLER: I don't know. The driver's side window is all bashed in, and he's got blood all over his head. He's not responding to me.
OPERATOR: What's your name, sir?
CALLER: My name is [caller provides name]. I think you need to hurry.
OPERATOR: Yes, I'm sending help your way. I just want to ask you a few more questions, okay?
CALLER: Go ahead, but send them while you're asking.
OPERATOR: Yes, sir. They're already on the way. Are you with him now?
CALLER: I'm standing right outside the garage door.
OPERATOR: Can you tell me how old he is?
CALLER: I don't know. He looks like maybe 35 or 40.
OPERATOR: Okay, hang on one second for me, okay?
OPERATOR: I apologize about that. How old is the patient again?
CALLER: I'm not sure. He looks maybe 35 or 40.
OPERATOR: Is he awake?
CALLER: He's moving his head around, but he's not responding. I've called his name and asked what's going on, but he's not responding to that. His head's just kind of rolling around.
OPERATOR: Is he conscious?
CALLER: Well, I can't tell.
OPERATOR: Is he breathing?
CALLER: I can't tell that. I'm assuming he's breathing if he's moving his head around. Did not hear him talk or anything.
OPERATOR: Okay. You said he's sitting in the car, right?
CALLER: Correct. In the driver's seat.
OPERATOR: Where exactly is he?
CALLER: In the driver's seat, inside the garage.
OPERATOR: Can you direct the emergency crews to him, sir?
CALLER: Sure, sure.
OPERATOR: Alright, I'm sending the paramedics to help you now. Just stay on the line. I'll tell you exactly what to do next.
CALLER: Okay.
OPERATOR: If it's safe to do so, see if he is conscious, breathing, or moving at all.
CALLER: It's not safe for me to do. I don't want to put my hand in there.
OPERATOR: Okay, well, help is on the way.
CALLER: Alright, standing by. I've heard about break-ins in the area, and so I decided to walk over and take a look. The garage door was up, and I saw the window is shattered and he's got blood.
OPERATOR: Just stand in line with me for now, okay, sir?
CALLER: Okay, I'm here.
OPERATOR: I got emergency crews on the way to you.
CALLER: Very good. I'm standing at the street. If I see them coming down, I can direct them right in.
OPERATOR: So he won't respond to you at all if you holler at him or anything?
CALLER: Yeah, he didn't respond, but his head is kind of moving around.
OPERATOR: Okay.
CALLER: I've walked away from the car right now. I'm standing at the street.
OPERATOR: The window shattered. The garage door was up, correct?
CALLER: Yes.
OPERATOR: Give me a second. I'll try to see where the emergency crews are, okay? Is he still moving around?
CALLER: I don't know. I'm standing at the street now trying to wait for your vehicle.
OPERATOR: Okay, where exactly are they coming from? Checking, got several people on the way.
CALLER: Yes, please hurry. We're close to the hospital.
OPERATOR: Well, it looks like one person is coming from Clay Road.
CALLER: So you're saying his head is bloody?
OPERATOR: Yes, the window is shattered. I don't know if he tried to shoot himself. I don't know what the situation is.
CALLER: Is the driver's side window shattered, correct?
OPERATOR: Yes, that's correct.
CALLER: He's still moving around, so he's alive.
OPERATOR: Okay, looks like I should have an officer coming up the roadway.
CALLER: We need EMT.
OPERATOR: Well, the officer's going to be there first. They're not going to come until we figure out what's going on, but EMT is on the way as well, okay?
CALLER: They better hurry if this guy's got a shot at living.
OPERATOR: Yes, sir. They're on the way as well, okay?
CALLER: Okay, looks like the officer is coming up right now.
OPERATOR: Is he there?
CALLER: Yeah, he's just coming up right now.
