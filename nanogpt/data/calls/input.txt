[0:01:02] caller: About three weeks ago.
[0:01:05] operator: Okay.
[0:01:05] operator: And you are going to jump off the building because of that or because of some other reason?
[0:01:11] caller: I have gotten myself into a lot of trouble lately.
[0:01:11] caller: And my girlfriend took my son from me and denied my visiting time.
[0:01:11] caller: I tried going to the courts and working things out.
[0:01:23] caller: My life is just shitty anyways, so I feel that I no longer need to live.
[0:01:28] operator: Okay.
[0:01:28] operator: And that's your final decision?
[0:01:28] operator: There's no way I can talk you out of that?
[0:01:28] operator: No.
[0:01:28] operator: I just would like to let you guys know, just for a heads up, what's going on.
[0:01:28] operator: Okay.
[0:01:28] operator: Tell me her name again.
[0:01:40] caller: I didn't write it down quickly enough.
[0:01:42] operator: Karina Bartley.

[0:01:42] operator: Um, hold on one second.

[0:02:06] operator: How old's your child?
[0:02:14] caller: He's 8 months old.
[0:02:16] operator: It seems too bad that you're not going to get to see him and talk to him when he's older, don't you think?
[0:02:23] caller: After I'd be in jail, I would have passed him anyway.
[0:02:27] operator: Don't you think he'd still prefer you were alive so he has a dad?
[0:02:33] caller: He probably would, but, you know, I'm thinking past that right now.
[0:02:39] operator: Okay.
[0:02:39] operator: How did you get up to the building there?
[0:02:39] operator: Did you walk or did you drive?
[0:02:43] caller: I don't have a vehicle so I walk.
[0:02:46] operator: Okay.
[0:02:46] operator: And you're just on top of like somebody's business or a parking structure or what?

[0:03:00] caller: It's a parking structure and I got a visual view of Pioneer Square.
[0:03:11] operator: Why don't you talk to me just a little bit longer before you do anything you can't take back?
[0:03:17] caller: I know I can't take it back once I do it and I really am debating on doing it or not but
[0:03:25] caller: my criminal background will be believed much out of this story.
[0:03:30] operator: Well you know what, I'm going to give you a really great deal.
[0:03:30] operator: Are you ready for this?
[0:03:30] operator: What?
[0:03:34] caller: This is a one-time only deal, and only from me.
[0:03:37] operator: I will believe everything you tell me on this phone call, everything.
[0:03:37] operator: You have my word.
[0:03:48] operator: Okay, so talk to somebody who is prepared to believe you.
[0:03:48] operator: Tell me your side.
[0:03:58] caller: All right, first off, the reason why my girlfriend broke up with me is because we got into a little argument.
[0:03:58] caller: She told the police officer that I hung up the phone while she was trying to make a police report, and that's why I got arrested.
[0:03:58] caller: I sat in jail for four days and got a restraining order for while I was in there.
[0:04:21] operator: When was that?
[0:04:21] operator: Was that a long time ago?
[0:04:24] caller: No, just recently.
